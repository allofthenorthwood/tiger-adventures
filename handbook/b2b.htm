            />Although tiger attacks on humans are unusual, they do occur.
            Because the human population of Asian is rising, farmers and loggers
            are begining to use areas where tigers live. This causes increasing
            conflicts between tigers and human. It is thought that most tigers
            who eat humans are sick or injured and unable to kill their usual
            prey. Once they have acquired a taste for human beings, however,
            they will in all likelihood continue to kill them.
          </p>
          <p>
            While man-eating tigers are a rarity in most parts of Asia, they are
            notorious in the Sunderbans, a 4,000 square mile (10,360 sq km)
            densely forested river delta area in India and Bangladesh that is
            the home of about 250 tigers. No one lives in the mangrove forests
            and swamps of the Sunderbans; however people do enter to fish and
            gather wood and honey. The Sunderban tigers seem to have targeted
            humans as prey, and dozens of human casualties are reported every
            year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several different methods have been used to combat man-eating tigers
            in the Sunderbans. One method uses human dummies fitted with
            electric wires from car batteries which administer a shock when
            touched by a tiger, training tigers not to attack humans. Another
            method uses simple masks of human faces which are worn on the back
            of the head. This effectively makes both sides of the head appear to
            be the front, deterring attacks from tigers which normally attack
            from behind. While this method seemed to work for several years, it
            appears that the Sunderban tigers have discovered the trick.<br />

Because the human population of Asian is rising, farmers and loggers are
begining to use areas where tigers live. This causes increasing conflicts
between tigers and human. It is thought that most tigers who eat humans
are sick or injured and unable to kill their usual prey. Once they have
acquired a taste for human beings, however, they will in all likelihood
continue to kill them.</P>

<P>While man-eating tigers are a rarity in most parts of Asia, they are
notorious in the Sunderbans, a 4,000 square mile (10,360 sq km) densely
forested river delta area in India and Bangladesh that is the home of about
250 tigers. No one lives in the mangrove forests and swamps of the Sunderbans;
however people do enter to fish and gather wood and honey. The Sunderban
tigers seem to have targeted humans as prey, and dozens of human casualties
are reported every year.</P>

<P>Several different methods have been used to combat man-eating tigers
in the Sunderbans. One method uses human dummies fitted with electric wires
from car batteries which administer a shock when touched by a tiger, training
tigers not to attack humans. Another method uses simple masks of human faces
which are worn on the back of the head. This effectively makes both sides
of the head appear to be the front, deterring attacks from tigers which
normally attack from behind. While this method seemed to work for several
years, it appears that the Sunderban tigers have discovered the trick.<BR>

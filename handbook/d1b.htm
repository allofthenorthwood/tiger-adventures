            NATURALSIZEFLAG= "3" ALT="Zoo ark with " vacancyno">That's exactly
            the approach zoos have adopted! Today, many zoos are like Noah's
            ark. Animal species around the world are threatened not by a flood
            of water but one of habitat destruction. Zoo arks build genetic
            reservoirs of endangered species to insure against their extinction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Noah saved the animals two by two. Zoos need to save hundreds or
            thousands of each species to ensure a healthy population. But
            "zoo arks" are limited in size and resources, so space is
            at a premium. So zoos must aim for quality over quantity when
            breeding animals. The goal is to maintain genetic diversity--the
            richest and purest genetic pool for each species.
          </p>
          <p>
            Genetic diversity helps tigers survive in many ways. It keeps
            animals strong and healthy. Their cubs are also healthier and more
            likely to survive. And genetic diversity helps tigers adapt to
            changes in their environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zoos must also balance the needs of all species, not just tigers.
            More exhibits for tigers mean fewer for jaguars or clouded leopards.
            Zoos must work together in order to efficiently manage as many
            endangered species as possible. To this end, the American Zoo and
            Aquarium Association (AZA) has developed the
            <a href="d1c.htm">Species Survival Plan (SSP)</a>. Similar programs
            have been developed by zoo associations in Europe, Asia and other
            regions.
          </p>
          <p>
            To preserve genetically healthy captive populations, zoos must work
            together to manage all of the individuals of a particular species as
            one large interbreeding population within their county or region of
            the world. The "Zoo Ark" includes the entire world of
            zoos, not just zoos in one country or region.
          </p>
          <p>
            As zoos become more successful at captive breeding, the focus has
            turned from taking animals from the wild to the possibility of
            <a href="d1d.htm"

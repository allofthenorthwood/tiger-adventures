"3" ALT="Zoo ark with " vacancyno">That's exactly the approach zoos have adopted! 
Today, many zoos are like Noah's ark. Animal species around the world are threatened 
not by a flood of water but one of habitat destruction. Zoo arks build genetic 
reservoirs of endangered species to insure against their extinction.</P><P>Noah 
saved the animals two by two. Zoos need to save hundreds or thousands of each 
species to ensure a healthy population. But &quot;zoo arks&quot; are limited in 
size and resources, so space is at a premium. So zoos must aim for quality over 
quantity when breeding animals. The goal is to maintain genetic diversity--the 
richest and purest genetic pool for each species.</P><P>Genetic diversity helps 
tigers survive in many ways. It keeps animals strong and healthy. Their cubs are 
also healthier and more likely to survive. And genetic diversity helps tigers 
adapt to changes in their environment.</P><P>Zoos must also balance the needs 
of all species, not just tigers. More exhibits for tigers mean fewer for jaguars 
or clouded leopards. Zoos must work together in order to efficiently manage as 
many endangered species as possible. To this end, the American Zoo and Aquarium 
Association (AZA) has developed the <A HREF="d1c.htm">Species Survival Plan (SSP)</A>. 
Similar programs have been developed by zoo associations in Europe, Asia and other 
regions.</P><P>To preserve genetically healthy captive populations, zoos must 
work together to manage all of the individuals of a particular species as one 
large interbreeding population within their county or region of the world. The 
&quot;Zoo Ark&quot; includes the entire world of zoos, not just zoos in one country 
or region.</P><P>As zoos become more successful at captive breeding, the focus 
has turned from taking animals from the wild to the possibility of <A HREF="d1d.htm">returning 
captive animals--or their genes--to the wild.</A></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="d.htm"><B>Back

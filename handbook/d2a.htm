Breeding Criteria</H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#663300">You said: Natural 
selection--let tigers pick their own mates</FONT></B></P><P>That may work fine 
in the wild, but zoos must control the breeding process much more closely. They 
want to ensure that captive tigers remain strong, healthy animals for generations 
to come. They can't simply mate with whichever tigers are convenient. That would 
create tigers with mixed or unknown lineages.</P><P>The main reason to breed captive 
tigers is to maintain genetic diversity (that is, a rich and varied tiger gene 
pool). Knowing the genetic history of all the animals in the breeding program 
helps prevent mistakes (like breeding animals that are closely related) that would 
be disastrous to the long-term survival of the gene pool, and tigers in general.</P><P>So 
how do zoos decide which animals to breed together? The mission of the <A HREF="d1d.htm">Tiger 
Survival Species Plan (SSP)</A> is to increase the genetic diversity of tigers 
in captivity. It defines this genetic diversity in two ways:</P><P><IMG SRC="gdchart.gif" WIDTH="325" HEIGHT="232" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="12"
VSPACE="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Chart: gene diversity"><A NAME="gd"></A><B><FONT
 COLOR="#663300">Gene Diversity </FONT></B>compares gene diversity retained in 
the captive population with the original amount of gene diversity in the founders. 
(Founders are tigers that were born in the wild and later captured and brought 
to a zoo. They have no known relatives among captive tigers.) The goal of the 
Tiger SSP is to retain 90% of captive tiger gene diversity over the next 100 years. 
Currently it ranges from 92% for Sumatran tigers to 96% for Siberian tigers. Without 
new genes from wild tigers, gene diversity will slowly decline.</P><P><B><FONT COLOR="#663300">Founder 
Genome Equivalents</FONT> </B>indicates how many founders (unrelated wild tigers), 
if perfectly bred in captivity, would have been required for the current level 
of gene diversity. For example, the Siberian SSP has 45 founders, so if these 
animals were bred perfectly the Founder Genome Equivalent would be 45. The actual 
Founder Genome Equivalent of the Siberian SSP is 12.6 because the captive tigers 
have not been bred perfectly.</P><P><IMG SRC="foundfge.gif" WIDTH="284" HEIGHT="220" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="12"
VSPACE="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Chart: Founders and FGE">A number of factors, 
including fertility, the age of the tiger and its location, are considered in 
addition to the founder genome equivalent when making breeding recommendations. 
The "best" choice for a breeding recommendation may not always be the 
one that is statistacally perfect.</P><P>To equalize the representation of each 
founder to the captive gene pool, the SSP management group bases its breeding 
recommendations on two genetic measures: Mean Kinship Value and Genetic Diversity.</P><P><B><FONT COLOR="#663300">Mean 
Kinship Value</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#663300"> </FONT>(MK) is an average measure 
of how related an animal is to all other animals in the population. If a tiger 
has many brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, and nieces and nephews, then 
the Mean Kinship Value is very high. If a tiger has few relatives, the Mean Kinship 
Value is very low. The lower the MK value, the fewer relatives it has among captive 
tigers. That makes it a rare animal with valuable genes. A tiger such as Ruslan 
(below) would have a high MK, because it has so many relatives (mostly descendents) 
in zoos.</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#CC6600">Family tree for "Ruslan,"

cubs died before their sex was determined</FONT></P><P>If a tiger has a Mean Kinship 
Value of 0.0, it is a "founder"--it has no relatives in that population. 
In that case, it represents "new blood"--and more importantly for long-term 
conservation efforts, "new genes." Tigers with a low MK should not be 
bred with tigers with a high MK; otherwise, its rare genes would forever be linked 
with common genes. By breeding tigers with low MKs (and few relatives) together, 
zoos try to make sure that each founder is equally represented in the gene pool.</P><P><B></B><A NAME="inbreeding"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#663300">Inbreeding 
Coefficient</FONT></B><FONT
 COLOR="#663300"> </FONT>reveals how closely related the tiger's parents were. 
The higher the coefficient, the more closely related the two mates are. Parent-offspring 
or brother-sister pairs have a coefficient of 0.25. In comparison, first cousins 
among humans would have a coefficient of 0.0625. Inbreeding is best avoided, since 
it can cause reduced fertility, increased mortality and birth defects. Also, a 
loss of genetic diversity reduces the ability of tigers to adapt to environmental 
change.</P><P><B><FONT COLOR="#663300">Other Considerations.</FONT></B> After 
the genetic analysis, the SSP must also consider several other aspects of the 
potential mating:</P><P><TABLE WIDTH="450" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0">

Moving a tiger from one zoo to another is very stressful for the tiger and may 
affect its ability to breed. If all else is equal, it's better to select a tiger 
from a nearby zoo than one from a distant zoo. It's also a good idea to select 
tiger that live in similar climates. For example, it's better to transfer a tiger 
from Chicago to Detroit rather than Chicago to Phoenix, for both distance and 
climatic reasons.</TD></TR> </TABLE><BR> <IMG SRC="fecund3.gif" WIDTH="258" HEIGHT="116" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="12"
VSPACE="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="captive tiger fecundity"><A NAME="age"></A><B><FONT
 COLOR="#663300">Age:</FONT></B> The SSP must look at several implications of 
a tiger's age. Male tigers are ready to mate by age three or four and remain fertile 
until fourteen or older. Females become fecund (ready to breed) by age two or 
three and remain so until eleven or twelve.</P> <P><BR> <IMG SRC="mortality.gif" WIDTH="258" HEIGHT="137" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="12"
VSPACE="12" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Captive tiger mortality">However, tiger mortality 
begins to rise at age twelve. The SSP must balance age and fecundity considerations 
with an eye on the animals' genetic value. Gene diversity is lost with each generation, 
so it's best to make generation length as long as possible--that is, to breed 
the animals when they are older rather than younger. With this strategy, however, 
the tigers may die before they are bred.</P><P><B><FONT COLOR="#663300">Institutional 
requests.</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#663300"> </FONT>When possible, the SSP gives 
priority to zoos highest on the waiting list for breeding recommendations. Many 
zoos want tiger cubs, since that helps them fulfill their dual mission: to be 
a zoo ark for endangered species, and to educate and entertain the public. Zoos 
often wait several years before they receive permission from the SSP to breed.</P><P><A HREF="d2e.htm"><B>More

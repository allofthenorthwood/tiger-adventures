              That's just what zoos do! They want to ensure that captive tigers
              remain strong, healthy animals for generations to come. They don't
              mate whichever tigers are convenient. That would create tigers
              with mixed or unknown lineages. Knowing the genetic history of all
              the animals in the breeding program helps prevent mistakes (like
              breeding animals that are closely related) that would be
              disastrous to the long-term survival of the gene pool, and tigers
              in general.
            </p>
            <p>
              So how do zoos decide which animals to breed together? The mission
              of the <a href="d1d.htm">Tiger Survival Species Plan (SSP)</a> is
              to increase the genetic diversity of tigers in captivity. It
              defines this genetic diversity in two ways:

              diversity retained in the captive population with the original
              amount of gene diversity in the founders. (Founders are tigers
              that were born in the wild and later captured and brought to a
              zoo. They have no known relatives among captive tigers.) The goal
              of the Tiger SSP is to retain 90% of captive tiger gene diversity
              over the next 100 years. Currently it ranges from 92% for Sumatran
              tigers to 96% for Siberian tigers. Without new genes from wild
              tigers, gene diversity will slowly decline.

              bred in captivity, would have been required for the current level
              of gene diversity. For example, the Siberian SSP has 45 founders,
              so if these animals were bred perfectly the Founder Genome
              Equivalent would be 45. The actual Founder Genome Equivalent of
              the Siberian SSP is 12.6 because the captive tigers have not been
              bred perfectly.

              and its location, are considered in addition to the founder genome
              equivalent when making breeding recommendations. The "best" choice
              for a breeding recommendation may not always be the one that is
              statistacally perfect.

            <p>
              To equalize the representation of each founder to the captive gene
              pool, the SSP management group bases its breeding recommendations
              on two genetic measures: Mean Kinship Value and Genetic Diversity.

            <p>
              <b><font color="#663300">Mean Kinship Value</font></b> (MK) is an
              average measure of how related an animal is to all other animals
              in the population. If a tiger has many brothers and sisters, aunts
              and uncles, and nieces and nephews, then the Mean Kinship Value is
              very high. If a tiger has few relatives, the Mean Kinship Value is
              very low. The lower the MK value, the fewer relatives it has among
              captive tigers. That makes it a rare animal with valuable genes. A
              tiger such as Ruslan (below) would have a high MK, because it has
              so many relatives (mostly descendents) in zoos.

              If a tiger has a Mean Kinship Value of 0.0, it is a "founder"--it
              has no relatives in that population. In that case, it represents
              "new blood"--and more importantly for long-term conservation
              efforts, "new genes." Tigers with a low MK should not be bred with
              tigers with a high MK; otherwise, its rare genes would forever be
              linked with common genes. By breeding tigers with low MKs (and few
              relatives) together, zoos try to make sure that each founder is
              equally represented in the gene pool.

              reveals how closely related the tiger's parents were. The higher
              the coefficient, the more closely related the two mates are.
              Parent-offspring or brother-sister pairs have a coefficient of
              0.25. In comparison, first cousins among humans would have a
              coefficient of 0.0625. Inbreeding is best avoided, since it can
              cause reduced fertility, increased mortality and birth defects.
              Also, a loss of genetic diversity reduces the ability of tigers to
              adapt to environmental change.

                  in similar climates. For example, it's better to transfer a
                  tiger from Chicago to Detroit rather than Chicago to Phoenix,
                  for both distance and climatic reasons.

            must look at several implications of a tiger's age. Male tigers are
            ready to mate by age three or four and remain fertile until fourteen
            or older. Females become fecund (ready to breed) by age two or three
            and remain so until eleven or twelve.

              animals' genetic value. Gene diversity is lost with each
              generation, so it's best to make generation length as long as
              possible--that is, to breed the animals when they are older rather
              than younger. With this strategy, however, the tigers may die
              before they are bred.

              since that helps them fulfill their dual mission: to be a zoo ark
              for endangered species, and to educate and entertain the public.
              Zoos often wait several years before they receive permission from

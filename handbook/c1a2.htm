a Zoo Exhibit</H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><BR> <B><FONT COLOR="#663300">You said: Limit 
the amount of space in the exhibit so the tiger is always close to visitors</FONT></B></P><P>That's 
a good goal. A zoo's primary goal is to educate people about animals and the natural 
world. By giving visitors a good view of the tiger, you are more likely to inspire 
them to learn and care about it.</P><P>However, you must not put the tiger in 
too small of an enclosure. That wouldn't be good for the tiger, and many visitors 
would become upset to see the tiger locked up in such a way. Visitors want to 
see healthy animals who appear content in their zoo homes.</P><P>On the other 
hand, even a very large exhibit is far smaller than a tiger's natural range. And 
such an exhibit will have many areas where visitors cannot see the tiger. Visitors 
to such an exhibit will be disappointed and perhaps even frustrated. They won't 
feel the same excitement about tigers if they glimpse it in the distance rather 
than up close --and they probably won't learn as much about tigers either. Such 
an exhibit would be considered unsuccessful.</P><P>Exhibit designers have to balance 
space and visibility when planning a tiger exhibit. Here are some things they 
must consider:</P><P><TABLE WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="794" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING=
"4"> <TR> <TD COLSPAN="2"><P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#663300" SIZE=+1>Size</FONT></B></P><P>A 
tiger exhibit must be big enough to give the tiger ample room to move about. An 
exhibit with one tiger ought to be, at the very least, 30 meters by 50 meters 
(100 feet by 150 feet). That's about the size of two house lots. A large exhibit 
would be about 80 meters by 150 meters (250 feet by 475 feet).</P><P>Zoo exhibits 
must also have night rooms next to the exhibit. Like all zoo animals, tigers are 
brought indoors every night for safety and care. They spend the night in a small 
room, which must be about three meters (10 feet) by four meters (12 feet). Every 
tiger in an exhibit must have its own night room.</TD></TR> <TR> <TD HEIGHT="262" WIDTH="47%"><P ALIGN=CENTER><BR>

keep the tiger within <BR> view of the zoo visitors</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH="53%"><P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;<BR> 
<B><FONT COLOR="#663300" SIZE=+1>Visibility</FONT></B></P><P>Visitors should be 
able to see the tiger from several vantage points. Ideally, the visitors should 
come nose-to-nose with the tigers for a thrilling, even mystical encounter. Some 
zoos give large cats the high ground so both tigers and visitors can see each 
other easily. Other zoos put the tiger in lower areas and allow visitors to view 
them from above.</P><P>Some zoos have large enclosures but contain the tigers 
in a smaller area close to the visitors to ensure good viewing. "Hot wires" 
can be installed to keep the tiger in view. Hot wires are electrified with a harmless, 
low-voltage current to keep tigers out of certain areas of the enclosure. An exhibit 
can then appear larger and more natural without hiding the tigers from view.</TD></TR> 
<TR> <TD COLSPAN="2"><P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#663300" SIZE=+1><BR> Security</FONT></B></P><P>There 
are many ways to keep tigers from escaping the exhibit. Years ago, most zoo exhibits 
used metal bars. In some cases, bars are still used, but many zoos now try to 
build barriers of wire, glass, or water which do not block visitors' views of 
the animals.&nbsp;</TD></TR> <TR> <TD HEIGHT="177"><B><FONT COLOR="#663300">Wire 
fences</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#663300">&nbsp; </FONT>are not as strong as bars but, 
if made of heavy-gauge welded wire, can be strong enough for tiger enclosures. 
They should be at least five meters (16 feet) high. At the top, the fence should 
be turned into the exhibit at a 45 degree angle. To prevent tigers from digging 
their way out of the exhibit, the base of the fence should be buried one meter 
(three feet) deep and turned into the exhibit at a 45 degree angle.</TD><TD>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="fence.jpg" WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="165" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

aesthetically pleasing and gives visitors a good, nose-to-nose view of the tiger, 
but it requires more maintenance and expense, and may fracture. It also prevents 
visitors from fully experiencing the tiger exhibit, since they cannot hear or 
smell the animals.</TD></TR> <TR> <TD HEIGHT="17"><P><B><FONT COLOR="#663300">Moats</FONT></B> 
can keep tigers in the exhibit while giving visitors a clear view of the tigers. 
They should be at least seven meters (23 feet) wide at the top and at least five 
meters high (16 feet) on the visitors side. A small ledge should be provided so 
cubs don't fall into the deep moat.&nbsp;</P><P>Moats must have a large drain 
to carry away rain, seepage and wash water. In cold climates, moats may freeze 
over if not drained, allowing the tiger to walk across the ice and out of the 
exhibit.</TD><TD><P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;Moat<BR> <IMG SRC="moat.gif" WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="101" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3" ALT="moat diagram"></TD></TR> <TR> <TD COLSPAN="2"><B><FONT COLOR="#663300"><BR> 
Large trees</FONT></B> should be kept away from the perimeter. Adult tigers are 
unlikely to climb any vertical trees, but young tigers may climb them and escape 
the exhibit. A wind storm may also knock a tree down, offering an escape route 
out of the exhibit.&nbsp;</TD></TR> <TR> <TD COLSPAN="2"><P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#663300" SIZE=+1><BR> 
Night Rooms</FONT></B></P><P>A tiger exhibit must also have off-exhibit night 
rooms where the tiger spends each night. By bringing the tigers in nightly, keepers 
can monitor the tigers' health closely and keep them safe at night.</P><P>Zoos 
participating in an approved breeding program must have at least three off-exhibit 
night rooms: one for the adult male, another for the adult female, and a third 
for the cubs.</TD></TR> <TR> <TD>A <FONT COLOR="#663300">squeeze cage</FONT>, 
shown here, offers a simple way to administer vaccinations, antibiotics, and other 
shots. As the tiger moves through the cage, it is briefly squeezed against the 
bars so the keeper can inject its shoulder with the medicine. This is a quicker, 
safer and less-stressful method than a dart gun, which might hit a bone or an 
eye, or total immobilization, which requires additional drugs. The tiger is freed 
before it realizes what has happened.&nbsp;</TD><TD>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="sqcage.gif" WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="126" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

            <h2 align="center">Tiger Genetics</h2>
            <p>
              The Siberian tiger studbook database is maintained in a computer
              software program called SPARKS (Single Population Analysis Records
              Keeping System) produced by ISIS (International Species
              Information System). SPARKS automatically calculates inbreeding
              coefficients, which indicate how related an individual animal's
              parents were (technically, it is the probability that an animal
              will become homozygous at a given locus by descent). You can find
              a more complete description as well as the method for calculation
              in any genetics textbook. Basically, SSPs strive to avoid
              inbreeding, which may lead to reduced fertility, increased
              mortality, loss of genetic diversity, and therefore reduced
              options to respond to environmental variation. I have enclosed a
              list of the inbreeding coefficients for the Siberian tigers
              currently in the AZA Tiger SSP. These coefficients do not change
              throughout the life of the animal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another concern in selecting the breeding animals in a managed
              population is to equalize the representation of each "genetic
              line" in the population. An animal is referred to as a "founder"
              if it represents a new genetic line to the population (i.e., has
              no relatives in the population). Founders can be wild-caught
              animals, or can come from another regional captive program, such
              as the EEP in Europe. In an ideal situation, each founder will be
              equally represented; the opposite of this would be to breed only
              one pair of founders and never breed any other animals in the
              population. The challenge of the SSP Management Group is to make
              breeding recommendations that avoid inbreeding and also equalize
              founder representation to minimize the loss of genetic diversity
              from the captive population. This is done with the assistance of
              genetic analyses conducted by a software program called GENES
              associated with SPARKS.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially the AZA SSP Masterplan process and associated breeding
              recommendations were based upon inbreeding coefficients and the
              founder importance coefficient (FIC) which served to equalize
              relative founder contributions as well as minimize inbreeding.
              More recently, management has been based on mean kinship value
              (MK). Mean kinship is an average measure of how related an animal
              is to all other individuals in the population. Not only does MK
              allow the equalization of relative founder contributions, but MK
              also allows the linkage of rare and common genomes to be avoided,
              making future equalization of founder contributions possible.
              Animals with a low MK share fewer genes with the rest of the
              population and are therefore more valuable as potential breeders
              than those animals with a high MK (e.g., a founder that has never
              bred has a mean kinship of 0 and therefore is genetically highly
              valuable). Care should be taken not to breed an animal with a low
              MK to an animal with a high MK; otherwise, rare genes would be
              permanently linked with common genes and could not be increased in
              frequency without simultaneously increasing common lineages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another value which is also used in management is the kinship
              value (KV), which is a weighted mean kinship which considers the
              reproductive potential of the animal's relatives in the
              population. For example, if animal A and animal B had the same
              mean kinship, and animal A had lots of relatives that were young
              and could produce lots of offspring, while animal B only had old
              relatives that were unlikely to produce any more offspring, then
              animal B would be considered more valuable to breed.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the Tiger SSP Management Group considers animals to pair for
              breeding recommendations, it first turns to the list of animals
              ranked by either mean kinship or kinship value. Animals at the top
              of the list are given high priority for breeding; animals near the
              bottom are unlikely to receive a breeding recommendation. Another
              major consideration is the location of each animal. The Management
              Group must consider which institutions have requested a breeding
              recommendation (there is a waiting list), which institutions want
              to keep their animals, and which institutions want to transfer an
              animal in or out of their institution. Distance from each other is
              also a consideration (it is better to transfer an animal from
              Chicago to Detroit rather than Chicago to Phoenix, both in terms
              of distance and climatic adjustment). It is best to minimize
              transfers when possible, as they are costly and involve some
              stress and risk for the animal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each potential breeding recommendation must also be separately
              checked for the inbreeding coefficient of any resulting offspring.
              For instance, the top ranked male and the top ranked female may
              look like a good breeding pair; however, they may be brother and
              sister and would produce cubs with a high inbreeding coefficient.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, every time one animal is born, dies, or is transferred in or
              out of the SSP population, the mean kinship changes for every
              animal in the population. For example, a brother and sister would
              have the same mean kinship value. If the female produces a large
              litter of cubs, this will lower their mean kinship (making them
              less genetically valuable). If the litter is made up of all
              females, the mother will drop more in rank relative to the other
              females and the male will drop less in rank relative to the other
              males. This is why potential breedings that look good one year may
              not look so good one or two years later as certain animals die and
              many litters are born.<br />

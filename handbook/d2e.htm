Siberian tiger studbook database is maintained in a computer software program 
called SPARKS (Single Population Analysis Records Keeping System) produced by 
ISIS (International Species Information System). SPARKS automatically calculates 
inbreeding coefficients, which indicate how related an individual animal's parents 
were (technically, it is the probability that an animal will become homozygous 
at a given locus by descent). You can find a more complete description as well 
as the method for calculation in any genetics textbook. Basically, SSPs strive 
to avoid inbreeding, which may lead to reduced fertility, increased mortality, 
loss of genetic diversity, and therefore reduced options to respond to environmental 
variation. I have enclosed a list of the inbreeding coefficients for the Siberian 
tigers currently in the AZA Tiger SSP. These coefficients do not change throughout 
the life of the animal.</P><P>Another concern in selecting the breeding animals 
in a managed population is to equalize the representation of each &quot;genetic 
line&quot; in the population. An animal is referred to as a &quot;founder&quot; 
if it represents a new genetic line to the population (i.e., has no relatives 
in the population). Founders can be wild-caught animals, or can come from another 
regional captive program, such as the EEP in Europe. In an ideal situation, each 
founder will be equally represented; the opposite of this would be to breed only 
one pair of founders and never breed any other animals in the population. The 
challenge of the SSP Management Group is to make breeding recommendations that 
avoid inbreeding and also equalize founder representation to minimize the loss 
of genetic diversity from the captive population. This is done with the assistance 
of genetic analyses conducted by a software program called GENES associated with 
SPARKS.</P><P>Initially the AZA SSP Masterplan process and associated breeding 
recommendations were based upon inbreeding coefficients and the founder importance 
coefficient (FIC) which served to equalize relative founder contributions as well 
as minimize inbreeding. More recently, management has been based on mean kinship 
value (MK). Mean kinship is an average measure of how related an animal is to 
all other individuals in the population. Not only does MK allow the equalization 
of relative founder contributions, but MK also allows the linkage of rare and 
common genomes to be avoided, making future equalization of founder contributions 
possible. Animals with a low MK share fewer genes with the rest of the population 
and are therefore more valuable as potential breeders than those animals with 
a high MK (e.g., a founder that has never bred has a mean kinship of 0 and therefore 
is genetically highly valuable). Care should be taken not to breed an animal with 
a low MK to an animal with a high MK; otherwise, rare genes would be permanently 
linked with common genes and could not be increased in frequency without simultaneously 
increasing common lineages.</P><P>Another value which is also used in management 
is the kinship value (KV), which is a weighted mean kinship which considers the 
reproductive potential of the animal's relatives in the population. For example, 
if animal A and animal B had the same mean kinship, and animal A had lots of relatives 
that were young and could produce lots of offspring, while animal B only had old 
relatives that were unlikely to produce any more offspring, then animal B would 
be considered more valuable to breed.</P><P>When the Tiger SSP Management Group 
considers animals to pair for breeding recommendations, it first turns to the 
list of animals ranked by either mean kinship or kinship value. Animals at the 
top of the list are given high priority for breeding; animals near the bottom 
are unlikely to receive a breeding recommendation. Another major consideration 
is the location of each animal. The Management Group must consider which institutions 
have requested a breeding recommendation (there is a waiting list), which institutions 
want to keep their animals, and which institutions want to transfer an animal 
in or out of their institution. Distance from each other is also a consideration 
(it is better to transfer an animal from Chicago to Detroit rather than Chicago 
to Phoenix, both in terms of distance and climatic adjustment). It is best to 
minimize transfers when possible, as they are costly and involve some stress and 
risk for the animal.</P><P>Each potential breeding recommendation must also be 
separately checked for the inbreeding coefficient of any resulting offspring. 
For instance, the top ranked male and the top ranked female may look like a good 
breeding pair; however, they may be brother and sister and would produce cubs 
with a high inbreeding coefficient.</P><P>Also, every time one animal is born, 
dies, or is transferred in or out of the SSP population, the mean kinship changes 
for every animal in the population. For example, a brother and sister would have 
the same mean kinship value. If the female produces a large litter of cubs, this 
will lower their mean kinship (making them less genetically valuable). If the 
litter is made up of all females, the mother will drop more in rank relative to 
the other females and the male will drop less in rank relative to the other males. 
This is why potential breedings that look good one year may not look so good one 
or two years later as certain animals die and many litters are born.<BR> </P><P ALIGN=CENTER><input type="button" value="Back to Previous Page"

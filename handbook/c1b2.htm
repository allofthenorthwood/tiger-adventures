                >You said: Zoo exhibits should imitate the tiger's natural
                environment to educate people about the tiger's natural

          <p>
            That's right, zoo exhibits are designed primarily to educate
            visitors. Nearly all zoo tigers are bred in captivity and have never
            lived in the wild. They are often called "ambassadors" to humankind.
            Their mission is to help us learn about the natural world. Visitors
            will learn more about tigers if the exhibit is designed to allow
            tigers to act as they would in their wild environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, a fun and and accurate environment may also be an
            entertaining and provocative home for the tiger. In this case, the
            two goals--educating visitors and satisfying the tiger--can work
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exhibit designers employ a variety of things to develop a an
            environment that is good for the tiger and appealing to the
            visitor:<br />

                <b><font color="#663300">Water</font></b> is very important to
                tigers. All tiger exhibits must have a source of clean drinking
                water, though in cold climates this is usually provided in the
                off-exhibit night rooms. Many exhibits also have a pool in which
                the tiger can bathe. Many zoos also include running water
                because it sounds pleasing and makes the exhibit more attractive
                and dynamic to the visitor.

                <b><font color="#663300">Plants</font></b> add to the visual
                appeal of a tiger exhibit. They can also conceal fences or other
                features of the exhibit which may detract from its overall
                appearance.
                <p>
                  Tigers may dig up new plantings, so some zoos favor plants
                  which tigers dislike. These include thorny barberry (<i
                    >Berberis sp.)</i
                  >, locust (<i>Robina sp.)</i>, hawthorne (<i>Crataegus sp.)</i

                  tasting cedar (<i>Cedrus sp.)</i> and juniper (<i

                <p>
                  Some plants, such as poison ivy and poison sumac, are toxic to
                  tigers and should be avoided.

a Zoo Exhibit</h2><p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font COLOR="#663300">You said: Zoo exhibits 
should imitate the tiger's natural environment to educate people about the tiger's 
natural habitat</font></b></p><p>That's right, zoo exhibits are designed primarily 
to educate visitors. Nearly all zoo tigers are bred in captivity and have never 
lived in the wild. They are often called &quot;ambassadors&quot; to humankind. 
Their mission is to help us learn about the natural world. Visitors will learn 
more about tigers if the exhibit is designed to allow tigers to act as they would 
in their wild environment.</p><p>Of course, a fun and and accurate environment 
may also be an entertaining and provocative home for the tiger. In this case, 
the two goals--educating visitors and satisfying the tiger--can work together.</p><p>Exhibit 
designers employ a variety of things to develop a an environment that is good 
for the tiger and appealing to the visitor:<br> </p><table WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="908" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0">

is very important to tigers. All tiger exhibits must have a source of clean drinking 
water, though in cold climates this is usually provided in the off-exhibit night 
rooms. Many exhibits also have a pool in which the tiger can bathe. Many zoos 
also include running water because it sounds pleasing and makes the exhibit more 
attractive and dynamic to the visitor.</td></tr> <tr> <td HEIGHT="215"><b><font COLOR="#663300">Plants</font></b> 
add to the visual appeal of a tiger exhibit. They can also conceal fences or other 
features of the exhibit which may detract from its overall appearance.<p>Tigers 
may dig up new plantings, so some zoos favor plants which tigers dislike. These 
include thorny barberry (<i>Berberis sp.)</i>, locust (<i>Robina sp.)</i>, hawthorne 
(<i>Crataegus sp.)</i>, pampas grass (<i>Cortaderia </i>sellona), and smelly, 
bad tasting cedar (<i>Cedrus sp.)</i> and juniper (<i>Juniperus sp.)</i>.</p><p>Some 
plants, such as poison ivy and poison sumac, are toxic to tigers and should be 
avoided.</td><td VALIGN="TOP"><p ALIGN="CENTER"><br> &nbsp;<img SRC="plants.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Plants in exhibit" WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="106"></p><p><br>

of the AZA Tiger SSP and Its Relation to the Global Siberian Tiger Program</H2><P ALIGN=CENTER>by 
Kathy Traylor-Holzer, Minnesota Zoo</P><P><B>Historical Overview of the Tiger 
SSP</B></P><P>The Tiger Species Survival Plan (SSP) was the first cooperative 
management program developed for captive populations in North America and has 
served as a model for subsequent management programs for other species coordinated 
by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA). The Tiger SSP was initially 
developed in 1982 by Dr. Ulysses Seal, who served as the Species Coordinator for 
ten years. Dr. Ronald Tilson took on responsibility for managing the Siberian 
(Amur) tiger population in 1987, and has served as the Tiger SSP Coordinator since 
1992. Today, the AZA Tiger SSP manages three tiger subspecies in North America 
as recommended by the Conservation Breeding Specialist Group's Tiger Global Animal 
Survival Plan (GASP): 154 Siberian tigers Panthera tigris altaica (coordinated 
by Ronald Tilson, Minnesota Zoo); 60 Sumatran tigers P.t. sumatrae (coordinated 
by Gerald Brady, Potter Park Zoo); and 10 Indochinese tigers P.t. corbetti (coordinated 
by Edward Maruska, Cincinnati Zoo).</P><P>There are currently 91 zoological institutions 
in North America which are official participating members of the Tiger SSP. These 
institutions are distributed throughout the United States and southern Canada 
over an area greater than that from London to Moscow, Gibraltar to St. Petersburg, 
and across a wide variety of climates. The Canadian tiger population is managed 
as a subset of the larger SSP population; transfers across the international border 
are minimized to avoid to lengthy permit process involved. Each SSP institution 
signs a Memorandum of Participation and appoints a representative to the Tiger 
SSP. An annual election is held among these representatives to elect three members 
to the nine-member management committee, each of which serve three-year terms. 
This management group works with the coordinators and studbook keeper to make 
breeding and management recommendations for the captive tiger population.</P><P>Since 
1982 the Siberian tiger SSP population has been managed to produce a gradual decline 
in the population from about 200 to 150 animals in order to produce cage spaces 
for the expansion of the Sumatran and Indochinese tiger programs. In addition, 
no breeding has been recommended for "generic" tigers (those of unknown 
origin with no designated studbook number), and additional cage space for tigers 
has been created as these animals gradually die due to old age.</P><P>As of October 
1995 there are 154 Siberian tigers maintained at SSP institutions, 100 of which 
comprise the managed population and the remaining 54 being designated as surplus. 
Historically, 15-35% of the Siberian tiger SSP population have been surplus animals. 
An individual is declared "surplus" if it is anticipated that it will 
never breed and contribute genetically to the population in the future. Selection 
criteria include: low genetic value (the genetic line is overrepresented and therefore 
the animal has a high mean kinship value); age (the animal is post-reproductive 
or is aging and is of low genetic value); and sterility or other condition whereby 
the animal is unable to reproduce. By excluding these individuals from the managed 
breeding population and from the genetic analysis, it is possible to get a more 
accurate genetic profile of the managed population. For instance, by including 
a genetically valuable but post-reproductive female in the genetic analysis, her 
offspring may not appear as particularly valuable for breeding until after her 
death. Also, designating an animal as surplus allows an institution more freedom 
in the management of the animal; for instance, zoos may neuter surplus animals 
or transfer them to non-SSP institutions without prior approval from the SSP.</P><P>The 
current age structure of the Siberian tiger population suggests a gradually declining 
population, with surplus animals primarily concentrated in the older age classes. 
Age-specific fecundity over the past 14 years is an artifact of captive management 
rather than a biological measure, and indicates that under SSP management conditions, 
females are most prolific between 5-8 years of age, while males show relatively 
high fecundity from 5-12 years of age. Mean litter size is 2.45 cubs per litter; 
most litters contain 2 or 3 cubs, but litters range from 1 to 5 cubs. Neonatal 
mortality is 34%. For animals surviving to one year of age, mean lifespan is about 
13 years. The major causes of mortality in adults based upon necropsy reports 
are various forms of cancer (especially mammary adenocarcinoma in females) and 
degenerative joint diseases in older males.</P><P>Although the managed population 
has been down-sized from 200 to 100 tigers over the past 14 years, genetic population 
measures have improved, suggesting more efficient management. Founder representation 
for most of the 45 founders is approaching target levels. Recent imports of wild-caught 
tigers occurred in 1991 and 1993. Each time, a pair of young animals (siblings) 
was imported after being found orphaned in the wild. The number of founders has 
increased from 29 to 45 since 1982, with a corresponding increase in the number 
of founder genome equivalents from 6.961 to 12.664. There has also been a gradual 
increase in gene diversity retained from 92.8% to 96.1%, with the SSP program 
goal being the retention of 90% gene diversity over 100 years. Descendant mean 
kinship, a measure of how related an animal and its descendants are to all other 
animals in the population, has decreased from 0.0722 to 0.0394, indicating that 
animals are relatively less related to each other. Finally, the mean inbreeding 
coefficient has decreased substantially from 0.102 to 0.020, meaning that there 
have been fewer breedings between close relatives.</P><P><B>Management Processes 
and Issues</B></P><P>Several processes and lines of communication are used to 
ensure the effective operation of the Tiger SSP. Annual inventory updates are 
sent to each institution; these are used not only to verify the current inventory 
and to request missing information, but also to update any institutional requests 
on file. These annual updates are meant to serve as back-up confirmation of information 
continually communicated between zoos and the SSP. Institutions are requested 
to submit any births, deaths or transfers to the SSP as they occur, so that a 
current database can be maintained. Copies of all necropsy reports are sent to 
the SSP as part of an analysis of the causes of mortality in the population. All 
institutional requests, such as requests for replacement animals, transfers of 
animals out of the zoo due to lack of sufficient space, and future breeding recommendations, 
must be made in writing as a form of documentation. Each year after the current 
inventory has been verified, a new genetic analysis is performed. The SSP management 
committee then produces a list of breeding recommendations for the next year, 
a list of recommended transfers to accommodate breedings and institutional needs, 
and a list of animals that are newly designated as surplus. Modifications to these 
recommendations are made as needed throughout the rest of the year.</P><P>Compliance 
with SSP recommendations is very good. Institutions rarely breed tigers without 
a SSP breeding recommendation despite the fact that there is a waiting list and 
zoos generally wait several years after their request before receiving a breeding 
recommendation. Institutions do not transfer animals that are part of the managed 
population to non-SSP institutions, and do not transfer them to other SSP zoos 
without prior SSP approval. Generally the SSP makes about 15-20 or more transfer 
recommendations each year, many of which are associated with breeding recommendations. 
The majority of these transfers are accomplished, but many are delayed due to 
weather conditions (extreme cold in the north or heat in the south) or because 
an institution needs to transfer another animal in or out first.</P><P>When determining 
breeding recommendations, the Tiger SSP takes the following factors into consideration 
in order of importance:</P><P>1) Mean Kinship Ranking: An effort is made to breed 
those animals of reproductive age at or near the top of the mean kinship list, 
with priority given to those with the lowest mean kinship value (i.e. highest 
ranked and most genetically valuable). Generally, only animals within the top 
third of the mean kinship list are given breeding recommendations.</P><P>2) Location: 
Zoos are requested to breed only if they have sufficient facilities and space 
to have the ability to separate animals if needed. Breeding institutions are required 
to hold resulting offspring for up to three years before being placed by the SSP. 
When pairing animals at different facilities, consideration is also given to minimize 
transfer distance and changes in climate. For example, if genetic factors are 
roughly equal, it would be preferable to transfer an animal only 90 miles from 
Milwaukee to Chicago (both cold climates) rather than 1,700 miles from Los Angeles 
(hot) to Chicago (cold).</P><P>3) Institutional Requests: When possible, priority 
is given to institutions highest on the waiting list for breeding recommendations. 
Consideration is also given to requests to move out or retain specific individuals 
at the zoo.</P><P>4) Inbreeding Coefficient: When a potential breeding pair has 
been selected, the inbreeding coefficient of the resulting offspring is determined. 
An effort is made to minimize inbreeding and avoid inbreeding coefficients greater 
than 0.100.</P><P>Compliance rate is good in that there are very few unwanted 
litters, and most zoos attempt to transfer and breed animals according to the 
recommendations; however, not all recommendations result in litters being produced. 
About 50-70% of the breeding recommendations involve the transfer of one or more 
animals. As mentioned earlier, this is not always accomplished or may be delayed 
due to weather conditions (animals often can only be shipped in the spring and 
fall) or due to other reasons. Breedings are not always successful even if both 
animals are at the same institution. Various factors may be responsible for this: 
the pair may not be introduced to each other, they may not be compatible, they 
may breed with no resulting pregnancy, or one of the animals may be sterile, in 
poor health, or die before breeding. In the Tiger SSP about 42% of breeding recommendations 
lead to litters being produced. Often those recommendations that are unsuccessful 
are carried over to the next year. Over the past six years 60 breeding recommendations 
have been made, resulting in 62 cubs. Although results are variable from year 
to year, on average one cub is produced for each breeding recommendation made.</P><P><B>Regional 
and Global Tiger Populations</B></P><P>Table 1 provides a brief comparison of 
the current status of the North American SSP and European EEP Siberian tiger populations. 
A third large captive population of Siberian tigers is held by zoos in Japan but 
this population is not included in this analysis. The EEP tiger population is 
larger, with 219 tigers compared with 100 tigers in the SSP managed population. 
The EEP population is also based upon more founders (53, with a potential of 65). 
However, the percent of gene diversity retained and the number of founder genome 
equivalents is essentially the same between the two populations. The average inbreeding 
coefficient is higher in the EEP but is relatively low for both populations. Overall 
the SSP is able to manage a smaller population as effectively as the larger EEP 
population, but has the distinct advantage of few international borders and a 
common language.</P><P>The North American captive population has 17 founders that 
are not represented in Europe, and Europe has 36 founders not represented in North 
America. If these two populations are combined and managed as a single population, 
one might intuitively expect a noticeable genetic benefit. In reality, there is 
only a relative small increase in founder genome equivalents and percent of gene 
diversity retained. The addition of new founders has the greatest impact on a 
population when the total number of founders is low, but a much smaller impact 
as the number of founders increase. However, the potential of each of the two 
populations managed individually, as well as the potential when they are managed 
as one population, is quite high; the percent of gene diversity retained has the 
potential to be as high as 99.1%. To reach this potential would require "perfect" 
management based upon genetics without practical or political considerations and 
therefore is probably not achievable.</P><P>The bottom line is that overall both 
the SSP and EEP Siberian tiger populations are currently in relatively good shape. 
Complete integration of the two programs is unnecessary and impractical. If, however, 
animal exchanges are considered between the two regions, there are a few animals 
in North America that represent founders close to their target representation 
in North America but are not represented in Europe; likewise, there are well-represented 
animals in Europe that are unrepresented in North America. These animals are young 
or are of breeding age and would make good candidates if an exchange was made 
between the regional programs. Such exchanges would provide the most benefit with 
the least effort. It is most important, however, that both the SSP and EEP continue 
to manage their Siberian tigers as effectively as possible to achieve their program 
goals. By doing so, we can strive to maintain the relatively high quality of the 
global captive population of Siberian tigers.</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Table 1.</B>

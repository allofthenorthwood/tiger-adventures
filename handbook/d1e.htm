              Evaluation of the AZA Tiger SSP and Its Relation to the Global
              Siberian Tiger Program
            </h2>
            <p align="center">by Kathy Traylor-Holzer, Minnesota Zoo</p>
            <p><b>Historical Overview of the Tiger SSP</b></p>
            <p>
              The Tiger Species Survival Plan (SSP) was the first cooperative
              management program developed for captive populations in North
              America and has served as a model for subsequent management
              programs for other species coordinated by the American Zoo and
              Aquarium Association (AZA). The Tiger SSP was initially developed
              in 1982 by Dr. Ulysses Seal, who served as the Species Coordinator
              for ten years. Dr. Ronald Tilson took on responsibility for
              managing the Siberian (Amur) tiger population in 1987, and has
              served as the Tiger SSP Coordinator since 1992. Today, the AZA
              Tiger SSP manages three tiger subspecies in North America as
              recommended by the Conservation Breeding Specialist Group's Tiger
              Global Animal Survival Plan (GASP): 154 Siberian tigers Panthera
              tigris altaica (coordinated by Ronald Tilson, Minnesota Zoo); 60
              Sumatran tigers P.t. sumatrae (coordinated by Gerald Brady, Potter
              Park Zoo); and 10 Indochinese tigers P.t. corbetti (coordinated by
              Edward Maruska, Cincinnati Zoo).
            </p>
            <p>
              There are currently 91 zoological institutions in North America
              which are official participating members of the Tiger SSP. These
              institutions are distributed throughout the United States and
              southern Canada over an area greater than that from London to
              Moscow, Gibraltar to St. Petersburg, and across a wide variety of
              climates. The Canadian tiger population is managed as a subset of
              the larger SSP population; transfers across the international
              border are minimized to avoid to lengthy permit process involved.
              Each SSP institution signs a Memorandum of Participation and
              appoints a representative to the Tiger SSP. An annual election is
              held among these representatives to elect three members to the
              nine-member management committee, each of which serve three-year
              terms. This management group works with the coordinators and
              studbook keeper to make breeding and management recommendations
              for the captive tiger population.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since 1982 the Siberian tiger SSP population has been managed to
              produce a gradual decline in the population from about 200 to 150
              animals in order to produce cage spaces for the expansion of the
              Sumatran and Indochinese tiger programs. In addition, no breeding
              has been recommended for "generic" tigers (those of unknown origin
              with no designated studbook number), and additional cage space for
              tigers has been created as these animals gradually die due to old
              age.
            </p>
            <p>
              As of October 1995 there are 154 Siberian tigers maintained at SSP
              institutions, 100 of which comprise the managed population and the
              remaining 54 being designated as surplus. Historically, 15-35% of
              the Siberian tiger SSP population have been surplus animals. An
              individual is declared "surplus" if it is anticipated that it will
              never breed and contribute genetically to the population in the
              future. Selection criteria include: low genetic value (the genetic
              line is overrepresented and therefore the animal has a high mean
              kinship value); age (the animal is post-reproductive or is aging
              and is of low genetic value); and sterility or other condition
              whereby the animal is unable to reproduce. By excluding these
              individuals from the managed breeding population and from the
              genetic analysis, it is possible to get a more accurate genetic
              profile of the managed population. For instance, by including a
              genetically valuable but post-reproductive female in the genetic
              analysis, her offspring may not appear as particularly valuable
              for breeding until after her death. Also, designating an animal as
              surplus allows an institution more freedom in the management of
              the animal; for instance, zoos may neuter surplus animals or
              transfer them to non-SSP institutions without prior approval from
              the SSP.
            </p>
            <p>
              The current age structure of the Siberian tiger population
              suggests a gradually declining population, with surplus animals
              primarily concentrated in the older age classes. Age-specific
              fecundity over the past 14 years is an artifact of captive
              management rather than a biological measure, and indicates that
              under SSP management conditions, females are most prolific between
              5-8 years of age, while males show relatively high fecundity from
              5-12 years of age. Mean litter size is 2.45 cubs per litter; most
              litters contain 2 or 3 cubs, but litters range from 1 to 5 cubs.
              Neonatal mortality is 34%. For animals surviving to one year of
              age, mean lifespan is about 13 years. The major causes of
              mortality in adults based upon necropsy reports are various forms
              of cancer (especially mammary adenocarcinoma in females) and
              degenerative joint diseases in older males.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the managed population has been down-sized from 200 to
              100 tigers over the past 14 years, genetic population measures
              have improved, suggesting more efficient management. Founder
              representation for most of the 45 founders is approaching target
              levels. Recent imports of wild-caught tigers occurred in 1991 and
              1993. Each time, a pair of young animals (siblings) was imported
              after being found orphaned in the wild. The number of founders has
              increased from 29 to 45 since 1982, with a corresponding increase
              in the number of founder genome equivalents from 6.961 to 12.664.
              There has also been a gradual increase in gene diversity retained
              from 92.8% to 96.1%, with the SSP program goal being the retention
              of 90% gene diversity over 100 years. Descendant mean kinship, a
              measure of how related an animal and its descendants are to all
              other animals in the population, has decreased from 0.0722 to
              0.0394, indicating that animals are relatively less related to
              each other. Finally, the mean inbreeding coefficient has decreased
              substantially from 0.102 to 0.020, meaning that there have been
              fewer breedings between close relatives.
            </p>
            <p><b>Management Processes and Issues</b></p>
            <p>
              Several processes and lines of communication are used to ensure
              the effective operation of the Tiger SSP. Annual inventory updates
              are sent to each institution; these are used not only to verify
              the current inventory and to request missing information, but also
              to update any institutional requests on file. These annual updates
              are meant to serve as back-up confirmation of information
              continually communicated between zoos and the SSP. Institutions
              are requested to submit any births, deaths or transfers to the SSP
              as they occur, so that a current database can be maintained.
              Copies of all necropsy reports are sent to the SSP as part of an
              analysis of the causes of mortality in the population. All
              institutional requests, such as requests for replacement animals,
              transfers of animals out of the zoo due to lack of sufficient
              space, and future breeding recommendations, must be made in
              writing as a form of documentation. Each year after the current
              inventory has been verified, a new genetic analysis is performed.
              The SSP management committee then produces a list of breeding
              recommendations for the next year, a list of recommended transfers
              to accommodate breedings and institutional needs, and a list of
              animals that are newly designated as surplus. Modifications to
              these recommendations are made as needed throughout the rest of
              the year.
            </p>
            <p>
              Compliance with SSP recommendations is very good. Institutions
              rarely breed tigers without a SSP breeding recommendation despite
              the fact that there is a waiting list and zoos generally wait
              several years after their request before receiving a breeding
              recommendation. Institutions do not transfer animals that are part
              of the managed population to non-SSP institutions, and do not
              transfer them to other SSP zoos without prior SSP approval.
              Generally the SSP makes about 15-20 or more transfer
              recommendations each year, many of which are associated with
              breeding recommendations. The majority of these transfers are
              accomplished, but many are delayed due to weather conditions
              (extreme cold in the north or heat in the south) or because an
              institution needs to transfer another animal in or out first.
            </p>
            <p>
              When determining breeding recommendations, the Tiger SSP takes the
              following factors into consideration in order of importance:
            </p>
            <p>
              1) Mean Kinship Ranking: An effort is made to breed those animals
              of reproductive age at or near the top of the mean kinship list,
              with priority given to those with the lowest mean kinship value
              (i.e. highest ranked and most genetically valuable). Generally,
              only animals within the top third of the mean kinship list are
              given breeding recommendations.
            </p>
            <p>
              2) Location: Zoos are requested to breed only if they have
              sufficient facilities and space to have the ability to separate
              animals if needed. Breeding institutions are required to hold
              resulting offspring for up to three years before being placed by
              the SSP. When pairing animals at different facilities,
              consideration is also given to minimize transfer distance and
              changes in climate. For example, if genetic factors are roughly
              equal, it would be preferable to transfer an animal only 90 miles
              from Milwaukee to Chicago (both cold climates) rather than 1,700
              miles from Los Angeles (hot) to Chicago (cold).
            </p>
            <p>
              3) Institutional Requests: When possible, priority is given to
              institutions highest on the waiting list for breeding
              recommendations. Consideration is also given to requests to move
              out or retain specific individuals at the zoo.
            </p>
            <p>
              4) Inbreeding Coefficient: When a potential breeding pair has been
              selected, the inbreeding coefficient of the resulting offspring is
              determined. An effort is made to minimize inbreeding and avoid
              inbreeding coefficients greater than 0.100.
            </p>
            <p>
              Compliance rate is good in that there are very few unwanted
              litters, and most zoos attempt to transfer and breed animals
              according to the recommendations; however, not all recommendations
              result in litters being produced. About 50-70% of the breeding
              recommendations involve the transfer of one or more animals. As
              mentioned earlier, this is not always accomplished or may be
              delayed due to weather conditions (animals often can only be
              shipped in the spring and fall) or due to other reasons. Breedings
              are not always successful even if both animals are at the same
              institution. Various factors may be responsible for this: the pair
              may not be introduced to each other, they may not be compatible,
              they may breed with no resulting pregnancy, or one of the animals
              may be sterile, in poor health, or die before breeding. In the
              Tiger SSP about 42% of breeding recommendations lead to litters
              being produced. Often those recommendations that are unsuccessful
              are carried over to the next year. Over the past six years 60
              breeding recommendations have been made, resulting in 62 cubs.
              Although results are variable from year to year, on average one
              cub is produced for each breeding recommendation made.
            </p>
            <p><b>Regional and Global Tiger Populations</b></p>
            <p>
              Table 1 provides a brief comparison of the current status of the
              North American SSP and European EEP Siberian tiger populations. A
              third large captive population of Siberian tigers is held by zoos
              in Japan but this population is not included in this analysis. The
              EEP tiger population is larger, with 219 tigers compared with 100
              tigers in the SSP managed population. The EEP population is also
              based upon more founders (53, with a potential of 65). However,
              the percent of gene diversity retained and the number of founder
              genome equivalents is essentially the same between the two
              populations. The average inbreeding coefficient is higher in the
              EEP but is relatively low for both populations. Overall the SSP is
              able to manage a smaller population as effectively as the larger
              EEP population, but has the distinct advantage of few
              international borders and a common language.
            </p>
            <p>
              The North American captive population has 17 founders that are not
              represented in Europe, and Europe has 36 founders not represented
              in North America. If these two populations are combined and
              managed as a single population, one might intuitively expect a
              noticeable genetic benefit. In reality, there is only a relative
              small increase in founder genome equivalents and percent of gene
              diversity retained. The addition of new founders has the greatest
              impact on a population when the total number of founders is low,
              but a much smaller impact as the number of founders increase.
              However, the potential of each of the two populations managed
              individually, as well as the potential when they are managed as
              one population, is quite high; the percent of gene diversity
              retained has the potential to be as high as 99.1%. To reach this
              potential would require "perfect" management based upon genetics
              without practical or political considerations and therefore is
              probably not achievable.

              The bottom line is that overall both the SSP and EEP Siberian
              tiger populations are currently in relatively good shape. Complete
              integration of the two programs is unnecessary and impractical.
              If, however, animal exchanges are considered between the two
              regions, there are a few animals in North America that represent
              founders close to their target representation in North America but
              are not represented in Europe; likewise, there are
              well-represented animals in Europe that are unrepresented in North
              America. These animals are young or are of breeding age and would
              make good candidates if an exchange was made between the regional
              programs. Such exchanges would provide the most benefit with the
              least effort. It is most important, however, that both the SSP and
              EEP continue to manage their Siberian tigers as effectively as
              possible to achieve their program goals. By doing so, we can
              strive to maintain the relatively high quality of the global
              captive population of Siberian tigers.

          <p>
            That's an admirable idea. However, a tiger in the wild roams over
            vast areas. The smallest tigers have a range of 10-15 square
            kilometers (4-6 square miles); the largest of them range over 400
            square kilometers (150 square miles).
          </p>
          <p>
            So even a very large exhibit is far smaller than a tiger's natural
            range. And such an exhibit will have many areas where visitors
            cannot see the tiger. Visitors to such an exhibit will be
            disappointed and perhaps even frustrated. They won't feel the same
            excitement about tigers if they glimpse it in the distance rather
            than up close --and they probably won't learn as much about tigers
            either. Such an exhibit would be considered unsuccessful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, you can't put the tiger in a small cage either. That
            wouldn't be good for the tiger, and many visitors would become upset
            to see the tiger locked up in such a way. Visitors want to see
            healthy animals who appear content in their zoo homes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exhibit designers have to balance space and visibility when planning
            a tiger exhibit. Here are some things they must consider:
          </p>
          <table
            width="450"
            height="794"

            cellpadding="4"
          >
            <tr>
              <td colspan="2">
                <p align="center">
                  <b><font color="#663300" size="+1">Size</font></b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A tiger exhibit must be big enough to give the tiger ample
                  room to move about. An exhibit with one tiger ought to be, at
                  the very least, 30 meters by 50 meters (100 feet by 150 feet).
                  That's about the size of two house lots. A large exhibit would
                  be about 80 meters by 150 meters (250 feet by 475 feet).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Zoo exhibits must also have night rooms next to the exhibit.
                  Like all zoo animals, tigers are brought indoors every night
                  for safety and care. They spend the night in a small room,
                  which must be about three meters (10 feet) by four meters (12
                  feet). Every tiger in an exhibit must have its own night room.

                  Visitors should be able to see the tiger from several vantage
                  points. Ideally, the visitors should come nose-to-nose with
                  the tigers for a thrilling, even mystical encounter. Some zoos
                  give large cats the high ground so both tigers and visitors
                  can see each other easily. Other zoos put the tiger in lower
                  areas and allow visitors to view them from above.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some zoos have large enclosures but contain the tigers in a
                  smaller area close to the visitors to ensure good viewing.
                  "Hot wires" can be installed to keep the tiger in view. Hot
                  wires are electrified with a harmless, low-voltage current to
                  keep tigers out of certain areas of the enclosure. An exhibit
                  can then appear larger and more natural without hiding the
                  tigers from view.

                  There are many ways to keep tigers from escaping the exhibit.
                  Years ago, most zoo exhibits used metal bars. In some cases,
                  bars are still used, but many zoos now try to build barriers
                  of wire, glass, or water which do not block visitors' views of
                  the animals.&nbsp;

                but, if made of heavy-gauge welded wire, can be strong enough
                for tiger enclosures. They should be at least five meters (16
                feet) high. At the top, the fence should be turned into the
                exhibit at a 45 degree angle. To prevent tigers from digging
                their way out of the exhibit, the base of the fence should be
                buried one meter (three feet) deep and turned into the exhibit
                at a 45 degree angle.

                  They should be at least seven meters (23 feet) wide at the top
                  and at least five meters high (16 feet) on the visitors side.

                  A tiger exhibit must also have off-exhibit night rooms where

                  Zoos participating in an approved breeding program must have

                  male, another for the adult female, and a third for the cubs.

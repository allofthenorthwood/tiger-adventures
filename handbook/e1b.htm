said: People kill tigers and sell them to support their family</FONT></B></P><P>Yes, 
that's the most common reason for killing tigers. People can earn money by selling 
tiger parts. These people are often very poor and must support their families 
in any way they can.</P><P>Some people may also kill tigers primarily to protect 
their livestock, but then sell the tiger's body to earn extra money. Tiger traders 
may pay poachers about $60 for a dead tiger. That is a lot of money for a peasant 
in India, but a tiny percentage of the thousands of dollars the tiger will bring 
at its final destination.</P><P>No one knows exactly how many tigers are killed 
each year by poachers. In India alone, where about half of the world's 4,500 to 
7,000 wild tigers live, it is estimated that poachers kill a tiger every day. 
Nor is the impact of poaching limited to the loss of the actual animal killed. 
A poached female may leave behind her cubs, who will probably die as well. The 
poaching of a male may trigger an intensive struggle among other males for his 
territory, disrupting breeding and causing cubs to be killed in the process.</P><P>Poachers 
use several methods to kill tigers. They may place poison in the carcasses of 
dead animals such as cows and domestic buffalo. Tigers that eat the dead animals 
also consume the poison and die. Forest ponds may also be poisoned to kill tigers 
that come to the pools to relieve their thirst.</P><P>Some poachers also use steel 
traps. These traps are so strong that it can take six people to pry one apart. 
Tigers are not the only ones to be caught in these traps. In some areas, poachers 
set so many traps that people are caught and injured in them as well.</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="e1.htm">Back

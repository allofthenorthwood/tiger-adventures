Species Survival Plan</H2><P>In North America, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association 
(AZA) has developed the Species Survival Plan (SSP), which is a cooperative management 
program among zoos. The Tiger SSP was developed in 1982 and was the first of 76 
SSPs now managing 125 endangered and threatened species. Similar cooperative programs 
operate in other regions, such as the Endangered Species Programme (EEP) in Europe, 
the Species Management Programme (SMP) in Australasia, and others. Each program 
is run by a Coordinator and Management Group which make recommendations about 
the care, management, transfer, and breeding of each individual animal in the 
program based upon its history and genetic background. This allows zoos to maximize 
the genetic health of the population given their limited cage space.</P><P>The 
Tiger SSP manages three of the five tiger subspecies: Siberian, Sumatran and Indochinese. 
Zoos in the Tiger SSP zoos (which does not include all tigers in North America) 
currently have about:</P><UL> <LI>160 Siberian tigers <LI>60 Sumatran tigers <LI>10 
Indochinese tigers (but there are plans to expand zoo cage space and the number 
of animals <LI>25 generic tigers (of unconfirmed pedigree, origin, orsubspecies) 
</UL><P>There are a total of 255 tigers in the tiger SSP.</P><P>The Tiger Global 
Conservation Strategy recommends the following distribution of tiger subspecies:</P><P><IMG SRC="capmgmt.gif" WIDTH="236" HEIGHT="237" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="15"
VSPACE="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Pie chart of captive managed tigers">Each 
subspecies is managed in the region where it is found in the wild (that is, Siberian 
tigers in Russia, Sumatran tigers in Southeast Asia, etc.). Whenever possible, 
more than one population should be maintained to prevent a catastrophe (such as 
disease epidemic, economic crash, war) in one population from wiping out all captive 
tigers of that subspecies. Europe has the most cage space for tigers, followed 
by North America, so these regions are managing more than one subspecies. The 
South China tiger is struggling with only 50 animals but ideally a second population 
will be established in the future. The eventual goal is to have at least 250 of 
each subspecies managed in captivity.</P><P><A HREF="d1e.htm"><B>More</B></A>

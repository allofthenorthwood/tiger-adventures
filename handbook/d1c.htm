            <h2 align="CENTER">The Tiger Species Survival Plan</h2>
            <p>
              In North America, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA)
              has developed the Species Survival Plan (SSP), which is a
              cooperative management program among zoos. The Tiger SSP was
              developed in 1982 and was the first of 76 SSPs now managing 125
              endangered and threatened species. Similar cooperative programs
              operate in other regions, such as the Endangered Species Programme
              (EEP) in Europe, the Species Management Programme (SMP) in
              Australasia, and others. Each program is run by a Coordinator and
              Management Group which make recommendations about the care,
              management, transfer, and breeding of each individual animal in
              the program based upon its history and genetic background. This
              allows zoos to maximize the genetic health of the population given
              their limited cage space.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Tiger SSP manages three of the five tiger subspecies:
              Siberian, Sumatran and Indochinese. Zoos in the Tiger SSP zoos
              (which does not include all tigers in North America) currently
              have about:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>160 Siberian tigers</li>
              <li>60 Sumatran tigers</li>
              <li>
                10 Indochinese tigers (but there are plans to expand zoo cage
                space and the number of animals
              </li>

              <li>
                25 generic tigers (of unconfirmed pedigree, origin,
                orsubspecies)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>There are a total of 255 tigers in the tiger SSP.</p>
            <p>
              The Tiger Global Conservation Strategy recommends the following
              distribution of tiger subspecies:

                NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"
                alt="Pie chart of captive managed tigers"
              />Each subspecies is managed in the region where it is found in
              the wild (that is, Siberian tigers in Russia, Sumatran tigers in
              Southeast Asia, etc.). Whenever possible, more than one population
              should be maintained to prevent a catastrophe (such as disease
              epidemic, economic crash, war) in one population from wiping out
              all captive tigers of that subspecies. Europe has the most cage
              space for tigers, followed by North America, so these regions are
              managing more than one subspecies. The South China tiger is
              struggling with only 50 animals but ideally a second population
              will be established in the future. The eventual goal is to have at
              least 250 of each subspecies managed in captivity.

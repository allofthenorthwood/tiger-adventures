Poaching</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#663300">You said: Big game hunters kill tigers
as sport</font></b></p>
<p>Decades ago, many big game hunters travelled to India and other
Asian countries to hunt tigers for sport. Since the 1960s, however,
such hunting has been banned in most countries. Tiger populations
are under too much stress from poaching and habitat loss to survive
a hunting season.</p>
<p>If tiger populations ever recover, big game hunting may become
way to help the tiger survive. Big game hunters would pay thousands
of dollars for the opportunity to hunt tiger. Though perhaps
difficult to accept, this money could provide valuable funds
anti-poaching patrols and other methods to keep tiger populations
strong and healthy. Similar approaches have been used to help save
the African elephant.</p>
<p>People who kill tigers, however, are usually poor peasants who
struggle each day to make a living. They often see tigers as
predators that attack and kill cows, pigs, and sometimes even
people. The easiest way to protect their livestock--and their
income--is by killing every tiger they can.</p>
<p>Many people, however, do not kill tigers strictly to protect
their own livestock. They also kill tigers because they can earn
money by selling tiger parts. These people are often very poor and
must support their families in any way they can. Tiger traders may
pay poachers about $60 for a dead tiger. That is a lot of money for
a peasant in India, but a tiny percentage of the thousands of
dollars the tiger will bring at its final destination.</p>
<p>No one knows exactly how many tigers are killed each year by
poachers. In India alone, where about half of the world's 4,500 to
7,000 wild tigers live, it is estimated that poachers kill a tiger
every day. Nor is the impact of poaching limited to the loss of the
actual animal killed. A poached female may leave behind her cubs,
who will probably die as well. The poaching of a male may trigger
an intensive struggle among other males for his territory,
disrupting breeding and causing cubs to be killed in the
process.</p>
<p>Poachers use several methods to kill tigers. They may place
poison in the carcasses of dead animals such as cows and domestic
buffalo. Tigers that eat the dead animals also consume the poison
and die. Forest ponds may also be poisoned to kill tigers that come
to the pools to relieve their thirst.</p>
<p>Some poachers also use steel traps. These traps are so strong
that it can take six people to pry one apart. Tigers are not the
only ones to be caught in these traps. In some areas, poachers set
so many traps that people are caught and injured in them as
well.</p>

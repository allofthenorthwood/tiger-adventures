a Zoo Exhibit</H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#663300">You said: Zoo exhibits 
should imitate the tiger's natural environment to make it feel at home.</FONT></B></P><P>Zoo 
exhibits <B>should</B> include elements of the tiger's natural environment as 
much as possible. However, the reason is as much to educate visitors about that 
environment as to remind the tiger of its home. Nearly all zoo tigers were bred 
in captivity and have never lived in the wild. They are often called &quot;ambassadors 
from nature&quot; to humankind. Their mission is to help us learn about the natural 
world. Visitors will learn more about tigers if the exhibit is designed to allow 
tigers to act as they would in their wild environment.</P><P>Of course, a fun 
and accurate environment will also be a more interesting and provocative home 
for the tiger. In this case, the two goals--educating visitors and satisfying 
the tiger--can work together.</P><P>Exhibit designers employ a variety of things 
to develop a an environment that is good for the tiger and appealing to the visitor:</P><P><TABLE WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="908" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING=

is very important to tigers. All tiger exhibits must have a source of clean drinking 
water, though in cold climates this is usually provided in the off-exhibit night 
rooms. Many exhibits also have a pool in which the tiger can bathe. Many zoos 
also include running water because it sounds pleasing and makes the exhibit more 
attractive and dynamic to the visitor.</TD></TR> <TR> <TD HEIGHT="215"><P><B><FONT COLOR="#663300">Plants</FONT></B> 
add to the visual appeal of a tiger exhibit. They can also conceal fences or other 
features of the exhibit which may detract from its overall appearance.</P><P>Tigers 
may dig up new plantings, so some zoos favor plants which tigers dislike. These 
include thorny barberry (<I>Berberis sp.)</I>, locust (<I>Robina sp.)</I>, hawthorne 
(<I>Crataegus sp.)</I>, pampas grass (<I>Cortaderia </I>sellona), and smelly, 
bad tasting cedar (<I>Cedrus sp.)</I> and juniper (<I>Juniperus sp.)</I>.</P><P>Some 
plants, such as poison ivy and poison sumac, are toxic to tigers and should be 
avoided.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P ALIGN=CENTER><BR> &nbsp;<IMG SRC="plants.jpg" WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="106" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

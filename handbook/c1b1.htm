            Zoo exhibits <b>should</b> include elements of the tiger's natural
            environment as much as possible. However, the reason is as much to
            educate visitors about that environment as to remind the tiger of
            its home. Nearly all zoo tigers were bred in captivity and have
            never lived in the wild. They are often called "ambassadors from
            nature" to humankind. Their mission is to help us learn about the
            natural world. Visitors will learn more about tigers if the exhibit
            is designed to allow tigers to act as they would in their wild
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, a fun and accurate environment will also be a more
            interesting and provocative home for the tiger. In this case, the
            two goals--educating visitors and satisfying the tiger--can work
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exhibit designers employ a variety of things to develop a an
            environment that is good for the tiger and appealing to the visitor:

                <b><font color="#663300">Water</font></b> is very important to
                tigers. All tiger exhibits must have a source of clean drinking
                water, though in cold climates this is usually provided in the
                off-exhibit night rooms. Many exhibits also have a pool in which
                the tiger can bathe. Many zoos also include running water
                because it sounds pleasing and makes the exhibit more attractive
                and dynamic to the visitor.

                  Tigers may dig up new plantings, so some zoos favor plants
                  which tigers dislike. These include thorny barberry (<i

                  Some plants, such as poison ivy and poison sumac, are toxic to

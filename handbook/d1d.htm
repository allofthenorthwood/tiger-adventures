tiger populations are a genetic insurance policy for the future. As long as tigers 
survive in the wild, we may not need to collect on this insurance. Already, some 
tiger populations are so small and isolated that their genetic diversity has become 
weak. If there are not enough tigers in an area, they may begin to mate with their 
own relatives. Such inbreeding is unhealthy because it can produce sick or weak 
cubs with birth defects. Inbreeding can also reduce the ability of tigers to adapt 
to environmental change.</P><P>Someday, wild tiger populations may decline or 
go extinct. Then the genetic pool of captive tigers will become immensely important.</P><P>There 
are several ways to transfer the genetic codes of captive tigers into wild populations, 
but biologists have not yet mastered any of them.<IMG SRC=

animals directly into the wild has succeeded with other animals (for example, 
the black-footed ferret and the red wolf), but tigers present a special challenge. 
It would be a very expensive program. First, the tigers would have to be habituated 
to the wild in a large enclosure in the field. Biologists would monitor their 
health and their success at hunting and breeding. Only when the tiger's survival 
seemed likely would they be truly released into the wild.</P><P>It would also 
be risky for the captive tigers, their wild cousins, and the people who lived 
in the area. The newly released tigers would face many new threats and challenges 
such as securing and defending their new territory from other tigers. Their survival 
would also rely entirely on their new hunting skills. The wild population of tigers 
might be exposed to new diseases which the captive tigers might have contracted 
at their zoos. And people in the area might be hurt or even killed by tigers which 
had little fear of humans and even saw them as they did their zookeepers--as providers 
of food.</P><P>Therefore, it would probably be necessary to release tiger offspring 
which had been reared in semi-natural areas, rather than their parents, who were 
habituated to people.</P><P><A HREF="d3a.htm#ai"><B>Artificial insemination</B></A> 
and <A HREF=
"d3a.htm#ivf"><B>In vitro fertilization</B> </A>are highly experimental procedures. 
One day, after much more research and testing, these methods may become the best 
way to reintroduce the genes from captive tigers into wild populations.</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><input type="button" value="Back to Previous Page"

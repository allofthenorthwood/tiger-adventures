            <p>
              Captive tiger populations are a genetic insurance policy for the
              future. As long as tigers survive in the wild, we may not need to
              collect on this insurance. Already, some tiger populations are so
              small and isolated that their genetic diversity has become weak.
              If there are not enough tigers in an area, they may begin to mate
              with their own relatives. Such inbreeding is unhealthy because it
              can produce sick or weak cubs with birth defects. Inbreeding can
              also reduce the ability of tigers to adapt to environmental
              change.
            </p>
            <p>
              Someday, wild tiger populations may decline or go extinct. Then
              the genetic pool of captive tigers will become immensely
              important.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are several ways to transfer the genetic codes of captive
              tigers into wild populations, but biologists have not yet mastered
              any of them.<img

            <p>
              <b><font color="#663300">Reintroducing</font></b> captive animals
              directly into the wild has succeeded with other animals (for
              example, the black-footed ferret and the red wolf), but tigers
              present a special challenge. It would be a very expensive program.
              First, the tigers would have to be habituated to the wild in a
              large enclosure in the field. Biologists would monitor their
              health and their success at hunting and breeding. Only when the
              tiger's survival seemed likely would they be truly released into
              the wild.
            </p>
            <p>
              It would also be risky for the captive tigers, their wild cousins,
              and the people who lived in the area. The newly released tigers
              would face many new threats and challenges such as securing and
              defending their new territory from other tigers. Their survival
              would also rely entirely on their new hunting skills. The wild
              population of tigers might be exposed to new diseases which the
              captive tigers might have contracted at their zoos. And people in
              the area might be hurt or even killed by tigers which had little
              fear of humans and even saw them as they did their zookeepers--as
              providers of food.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, it would probably be necessary to release tiger
              offspring which had been reared in semi-natural areas, rather than
              their parents, who were habituated to people.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="d3a.htm#ai"><b>Artificial insemination</b></a> and
              <a href="d3a.htm#ivf"><b>In vitro fertilization</b></a> are highly
              experimental procedures. One day, after much more research and
              testing, these methods may become the best way to reintroduce the
              genes from captive tigers into wild populations.

    <p>1. Who are you? What's your job?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>2. Where has the tiger escaped from?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      3. Julia Allende's report about the missing tiger includes a plaster cast
      of a pugmark (pawprint). Do you think this pugmark was made by the runaway
      tiger? Why or why not?
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      4. Clem Taylor's report included some fur from a wild animal. Do you think
      this fur was left by the runaway tiger? Why or why not?
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      5. Jason Cooper may have spotted the runaway tiger in a tree. Do you think
      his report is reliable evidence of the tiger's whereabouts? Why or why
      not?
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      6. Danny Bence may have spotted the runaway tiger by the river. Do you
      think his report is reliable evidence of the tiger's whereabouts? Why or
      why not?
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      7. Victor Hernandez may have encountered the tiger at his ranch. Do you
      think his report is reliable evidence of the tiger's whereabouts? Why or
      why not?
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      8. Where do you think Police Chief Slayton should concentrate his search
      for the runaway tiger? Why?
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      9. After you learn the tiger's size and weight from Chief Slayton, what
      subspecies do you think the tiger is most likely to be? Why?

a runaway tiger by jumping into the Rio Grande.<BR> <IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
ALT="spacer gif">The tiger, which escaped yesterday from the airport (see related 
story), leapt out of the bushes near the old Milagro bridge over the Rio Grande. 
Danny Bence, age ten, was fishing from the bridge when the tiger appeared. &quot;He 
come straight at me. I figured he wanted my bucket of fish, so I left it and ran 
off the bridge. But that tiger, he kept coming right for me.&quot; <BR> <IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
ALT="spacer gif">&quot;I tried to hide in the bushes,&quot; Danny said, &quot;but 
that tiger wasn't fooled. So I run right into the river. Sure was cold, but that 
tiger stopped dead in his tracks. He wasn't gonna come in the water.&quot;<BR>

ALT="spacer gif">Danny waited in the river until the tiger wandered away, then 
swam to the opposite shore and ran home. His parents returned with him to the 
bridge, where they found his bucket of fish and tackle box untouched. &quot;It's 
a miracle that my Danny wasn't hurt,&quot; said his mother, Christine Bence. &quot;I 
only hope that they catch that tiger before anyone really does get hurt.&quot;&nbsp;</TD><TD WIDTH="33%" VALIGN="TOP"><P><IMG SRC="../advengrp/newstig.jpg" WIDTH="154" HEIGHT="91" ALIGN="BOTTOM"

ALT="spacer gif">A tiger was accidentally released yesterday from a cargo container 
at the San Gabriel International Airport. The tiger, which arrived on a flight 
from Hawaii, bolted from its carrying container when customs officials opened 
the cage to give it water. The tiger escaped the customs area and leapt over the 
airport's low perimeter fence. The time of the tiger's escape was estimated by 
customs officials as approximately 4:45 p.m.<BR> <IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">Chief 
of Customs Ernie Hidalgo refused to comment on the incident. A source to the San 
Gabriel Gazette speculated that the tiger may have been brought into the country 
illegally. &quot;Some people will pay a lot of money--$10,000, $20,000 or more--for 
an animal like this. They have private menageries with all kinds of exotic wildlife.&quot; 
No one has yet claimed the runaway tiger, and customs officials have not been 
able to locate the passenger responsible for the tiger.<BR> <IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">San 
Gabriel Police Chief Michael Hutchinson called for calm in the wake of the tiger's 
escape. &quot;There's no reason to panic. My officers are tracking down the tiger 
as we speak. I'm sure we'll find him by this evening.&quot;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="33%">&nbsp;<B>'Dr. 
Tiger' Advises Calm<BR> </B><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"0" ALT="spacer gif">Reknowned tiger expert Dr. Laohu, better known as &quot;Dr. 
Tiger,&quot; advised the people of San Gabriel to remain calm in the wake of a 
tiger's escape from the San Gabriel International Airport. Speaking from his office 
in Victoria, Canada, he said, &quot;Tigers are shy, solitary animals. They are 
not going to race down Main Street eating everyone in their path.&quot;<BR> <IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
ALT="spacer gif">However, Dr. Laohu said that the runaway tiger could present 
a serious threat to people if it was unable to find other food. He advised people 
to stay away from remote areas. &quot;I wouldn't go for a walk in the woods tonight,&quot; 
he said. &quot;On the other hand, if the tiger can find enough cover and food, 
you might go months before anyone spotted it.&quot; <BR> <IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
ALT="spacer gif">Dr. Laohu also expressed concern for the tiger's well-being. 
&quot;It seems unlikely that this is a wild tiger. Based on its behavior at the 
airport, it was probably captured as a cub and raised by people. If it is in fact 
a hand-raised tiger, I'm afraid that it won't know how to survive in the wild.&quot;</TD></TR>

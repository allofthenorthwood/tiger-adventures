                />The tiger, which escaped yesterday from the airport (see
                related story), leapt out of the bushes near the old Milagro
                bridge over the Rio Grande. Danny Bence, age ten, was fishing
                from the bridge when the tiger appeared. "He come straight at
                me. I figured he wanted my bucket of fish, so I left it and ran
                off the bridge. But that tiger, he kept coming right for me."<br />

                  alt="spacer gif"
                />"I tried to hide in the bushes," Danny said, "but that tiger
                wasn't fooled. So I run right into the river. Sure was cold, but
                that tiger stopped dead in his tracks. He wasn't gonna come in
                the water."<br />

                  alt="spacer gif"
                />Danny waited in the river until the tiger wandered away, then
                swam to the opposite shore and ran home. His parents returned
                with him to the bridge, where they found his bucket of fish and
                tackle box untouched. "It's a miracle that my Danny wasn't
                hurt," said his mother, Christine Bence. "I only hope that they
                catch that tiger before anyone really does get hurt."&nbsp;

                  />A tiger was accidentally released yesterday from a cargo
                  container at the San Gabriel International Airport. The tiger,
                  which arrived on a flight from Hawaii, bolted from its
                  carrying container when customs officials opened the cage to
                  give it water. The tiger escaped the customs area and leapt
                  over the airport's low perimeter fence. The time of the
                  tiger's escape was estimated by customs officials as
                  approximately 4:45 p.m.<br />
                  <img

                    naturalsizeflag="0"
                  />Chief of Customs Ernie Hidalgo refused to comment on the
                  incident. A source to the San Gabriel Gazette speculated that
                  the tiger may have been brought into the country illegally.
                  "Some people will pay a lot of money--$10,000, $20,000 or
                  more--for an animal like this. They have private menageries
                  with all kinds of exotic wildlife." No one has yet claimed the
                  runaway tiger, and customs officials have not been able to
                  locate the passenger responsible for the tiger.<br />

                  />San Gabriel Police Chief Michael Hutchinson called for calm
                  in the wake of the tiger's escape. "There's no reason to
                  panic. My officers are tracking down the tiger as we speak.
                  I'm sure we'll find him by this evening."

                />Reknowned tiger expert Dr. Laohu, better known as "Dr. Tiger,"
                advised the people of San Gabriel to remain calm in the wake of
                a tiger's escape from the San Gabriel International Airport.
                Speaking from his office in Victoria, Canada, he said, "Tigers
                are shy, solitary animals. They are not going to race down Main
                Street eating everyone in their path."<br />
                <img
                  src="dot.gif"

                  naturalsizeflag="0"
                  alt="spacer gif"
                />However, Dr. Laohu said that the runaway tiger could present a
                serious threat to people if it was unable to find other food. He
                advised people to stay away from remote areas. "I wouldn't go
                for a walk in the woods tonight," he said. "On the other hand,
                if the tiger can find enough cover and food, you might go months
                before anyone spotted it."<br />
                <img
                  src="dot.gif"

                  alt="spacer gif"
                />Dr. Laohu also expressed concern for the tiger's well-being.
                "It seems unlikely that this is a wild tiger. Based on its
                behavior at the airport, it was probably captured as a cub and
                raised by people. If it is in fact a hand-raised tiger, I'm
                afraid that it won't know how to survive in the wild."

                  related story), leapt out of the bushes near the old Milagro
                  bridge over the Rio Grande. Danny Bence, age ten, was fishing
                  from the bridge when the tiger appeared. "He come
                  straight at me. I figured he wanted my bucket of fish, so I
                  left it and ran off the bridge. But that tiger, he kept coming
                  right for me." <br />

                  "but that tiger wasn't fooled. So I run right into the
                  river. Sure was cold, but that tiger stopped dead in his
                  tracks. He wasn't gonna come in the water."<br />

                  />Danny waited in the river until the tiger wandered away,
                  then swam to the opposite shore and ran home. His parents
                  returned with him to the bridge, where they found his bucket
                  of fish and tackle box untouched. "It's a miracle that my
                  Danny wasn't hurt," said his mother, Christine Bence.
                  "I only hope that they catch that tiger before anyone
                  really does get hurt."&nbsp;

                    container at the San Gabriel International Airport. The
                    tiger, which arrived on a flight from Hawaii, bolted from
                    its carrying container when customs officials opened the
                    cage to give it water. The tiger escaped the customs area
                    and leapt over the airport's low perimeter fence. The time
                    of the tiger's escape was estimated by customs officials as
                    approximately 4:45 p.m.<br />

                      NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
                    />Chief of Customs Ernie Hidalgo refused to comment on the
                    incident. A source to the San Gabriel Gazette speculated
                    that the tiger may have been brought into the country
                    illegally. "Some people will pay a lot of
                    money--$10,000, $20,000 or more--for an animal like this.
                    They have private menageries with all kinds of exotic
                    wildlife." No one has yet claimed the runaway tiger,
                    and customs officials have not been able to locate the
                    passenger responsible for the tiger.<br />

                    />San Gabriel Police Chief Michael Hutchinson called for
                    calm in the wake of the tiger's escape. "There's no
                    reason to panic. My officers are tracking down the tiger as
                    we speak. I'm sure we'll find him by this evening."

                  />Reknowned tiger expert Dr. Laohu, better known as "Dr.
                  Tiger," advised the people of San Gabriel to remain calm
                  in the wake of a tiger's escape from the San Gabriel
                  International Airport. Speaking from his office in Victoria,
                  Canada, he said, "Tigers are shy, solitary animals. They
                  are not going to race down Main Street eating everyone in
                  their path."<br />
                  <img
                    src="dot.gif"

                    alt="spacer gif"
                  />However, Dr. Laohu said that the runaway tiger could present
                  a serious threat to people if it was unable to find other
                  food. He advised people to stay away from remote areas.
                  "I wouldn't go for a walk in the woods tonight," he
                  said. "On the other hand, if the tiger can find enough
                  cover and food, you might go months before anyone spotted
                  it." <br />
                  <img
                    src="dot.gif"

                    alt="spacer gif"
                  />Dr. Laohu also expressed concern for the tiger's well-being.
                  "It seems unlikely that this is a wild tiger. Based on
                  its behavior at the airport, it was probably captured as a cub
                  and raised by people. If it is in fact a hand-raised tiger,
                  I'm afraid that it won't know how to survive in the
                  wild."

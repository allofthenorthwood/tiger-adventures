          <p>Dear Zookeeper,</p>
          <p>
            We've caught the tiger! Thanks to your analysis, my officers and the
            DNR biologists soon picked up the tiger's trail in the State Forest.
            They found the runaway in a few hours. Apparently it looked a bit
            forlorn--hungry, I'm sure, and maybe even a little lonely. The DNR
            people had no trouble getting close enough to shoot it with a
            tranquilizer gun. No question about it now--this tiger was raised by
            people. It was probably glad to be captured.
          </p>
          <p>
            I received your message about the subspecies. So both people
            claiming this tiger are lying, are they? At least I can finally get
            them off my back. In fact, I think I'll call them myself to
            personally deliver the news.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the way, my men measured the tiger as soon as they had it in
            custody. Maybe these numbers will help you make the final analysis
            about the subspecies. Length: 2.3 meters, weight 100 kg. What do you
            think? Is it a <b><a href="c32.htm">South China</a></b> or
            <b><a href="c33.htm">Sumatran tiger</a></b
            >?

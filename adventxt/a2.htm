          <p>Dear Zookeeper,</p>
          <p>
            I'm sure you've heard that a tiger escaped yesterday from the
            airport. Unfortunately, my officers have so far been unsuccessful in
            locating and capturing this tiger. I've contacted the National
            Guard, but I hope we can find this tiger before it triggers a
            state-wide panic.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been in contact with several wildlife biologists at the
            Department of Natural Resources, but they're familiar with mountain
            lions, not tigers. They suggested I contact you.
          </p>
          <p>How can you help us? In two ways:</p>
          <p>
            1) Reports are coming in about the tiger. We'd like to fax these
            reports on to you. It wouldn't surprise me if some of these are the
            product of overactive imaginations, or maybe even deliberate hoaxes.
            I need you to tell me which reports are probably true, and worth
            pursuing.
          </p>
          <p>
            2) I've also received several phone calls from people claiming the
            tiger. My secretary tells me that there are several subspecies of
            tigers, so I asked each caller what kind of tiger they had lost. One
            caller said that his missing tiger was a Siberian tiger. The other
            said that his was a Bengal tiger. Obviously, one of them is lying. I
            want to have this runaway tiger identified, and identified soon-even
            before we capture the tiger. The last thing I need is a catfight at
            HQ over ownership of the tiger. Can you help us with this as well?
          </p>
          <p>
            My kids tell me that you don't have any tigers at the zoo, but you
            still probably know more about tigers than any of us here at the
            Police Department. I also called Dr. Laohu at the Victoria Zoo in
            Canada. He's offered to help you in any way he can. You'll probably
            be hearing from him soon.
          </p>

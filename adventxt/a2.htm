</TABLE></P> <P>Dear Zookeeper,</P><P>I'm sure you've heard that a tiger escaped 
yesterday from the airport. Unfortunately, my officers have so far been unsuccessful 
in locating and capturing this tiger. I've contacted the National Guard, but I 
hope we can find this tiger before it triggers a state-wide panic.</P><P>I've 
been in contact with several wildlife biologists at the Department of Natural 
Resources, but they're familiar with mountain lions, not tigers. They suggested 
I contact you.</P><P>How can you help us? In two ways:</P><P>1) Reports are coming 
in about the tiger. We'd like to fax these reports on to you. It wouldn't surprise 
me if some of these are the product of overactive imaginations, or maybe even 
deliberate hoaxes. I need you to tell me which reports are probably true, and 
worth pursuing.</P><P>2) I've also received several phone calls from people claiming 
the tiger. My secretary tells me that there are several subspecies of tigers, 
so I asked each caller what kind of tiger they had lost. One caller said that 
his missing tiger was a Siberian tiger. The other said that his was a Bengal tiger. 
Obviously, one of them is lying. I want to have this runaway tiger identified, 
and identified soon-even before we capture the tiger. The last thing I need is 
a catfight at HQ over ownership of the tiger. Can you help us with this as well?</P><P>My 
kids tell me that you don't have any tigers at the zoo, but you still probably 
know more about tigers than any of us here at the Police Department. I also called 
Dr. Laohu at the Victoria Zoo in Canada. He's offered to help you in any way he 
can. You'll probably be hearing from him soon.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#663300" SIZE=+1>What

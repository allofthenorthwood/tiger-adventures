to John Jimenez, one of the customs officials at the scene of the incident, the 
tiger appeared to be calm and friendly. "He was just laying there in his 
cage. He wasn't snarling or hissing or anything. We figured he must've been thirsty. 
None of us figured he could move so fast."<BR> <IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">According 
to Customs Chief Ernie Hidalgo, the tiger may have been brought into the country 
illegally.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;"Some people will pay a lot of money--$10,000, 
$20,000 or more--for an animal like this," he said. "They have private 
menageries with all kinds of exotic wildlife." No one has yet claimed the 
runaway tiger, and customs has not been able to locate the passenger responsible 
for the tiger.<BR> <IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">San 
Gabriel Police Chief Michael Hutchinson called for calm in the wake of the tiger's 
escape. "There's no reason to panic. My officers are tracking down the tiger 
as we speak."</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P><B>Tiger Expert, cont.</B></P><P><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

and food, you might go months before anyone spotted it." <BR> <IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
ALT="spacer gif">Dr. Laohu also expressed concern for the tiger's well-being. 
"Based on the tiger's behavior at the airport, it was probably captured as 
a cub and raised by people. If it is in fact a hand-raised tiger, I'm afraid that 
it won't know how to survive in the wild."</TD></TR> </TABLE></P> <H4 ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="a2.htm">Okay,

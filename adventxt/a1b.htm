                scene of the incident, the tiger appeared to be calm and
                friendly. "He was just laying there in his cage. He wasn't
                snarling or hissing or anything. We figured he must've been
                thirsty. None of us figured he could move so fast."<br />

                />According to Customs Chief Ernie Hidalgo, the tiger may have
                been brought into the country illegally.

                &nbsp;"Some people will pay a lot of money--$10,000, $20,000 or
                more--for an animal like this," he said. "They have private
                menageries with all kinds of exotic wildlife." No one has yet
                claimed the runaway tiger, and customs has not been able to
                locate the passenger responsible for the tiger.<br />

                />San Gabriel Police Chief Michael Hutchinson called for calm in
                the wake of the tiger's escape. "There's no reason to panic. My
                officers are tracking down the tiger as we speak."

                  />Dr. Laohu also expressed concern for the tiger's well-being.
                  "Based on the tiger's behavior at the airport, it was probably
                  captured as a cub and raised by people. If it is in fact a
                  hand-raised tiger, I'm afraid that it won't know how to
                  survive in the wild."

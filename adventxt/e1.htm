</TABLE></P> <P>Congratulations! You've helped the police capture a runaway tiger, 
and identified its subspecies without even laying eyes on the animal itself. That's 
quite an accomplishment.</P><P>The question facing us now, of course, is: Now 
what? Police Chief Slayton informs me that no one has come forth with a legitimate 
claim on this tiger. He's consulted with the regional office of the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service to determine the fate of this tiger. It's not often that 
a tiger shows up in the United States, unclaimed. The Fish and Wildlife Service 
has no facility in which to keep it. After consultating with Police Chief Slayton, 
Fish and Wildlife has decided that the tiger should be donated to an organization 
which has both the facilities and the expertise to keep non-native animals. Your 
zoo, being accredited by the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums, would 
be such an organization.</P><P>I know that you haven't any tigers at your zoo 
currently, nor perhaps a permanent outdoor exhibit area for a tiger. If you choose 
to keep this tiger, you'll have to design and build an appropriate exhibit which 
ensures both your tiger's health and visitors' education and enjoyment. I'd be 
happy to help you design this exhibit.</P><P><IMG SRC="../advengrp/dot.gif" WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="BOTTOM"

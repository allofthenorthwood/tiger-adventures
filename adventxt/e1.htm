          <p>
            Congratulations! You've helped the police capture a runaway tiger,
            and identified its subspecies without even laying eyes on the animal
            itself. That's quite an accomplishment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The question facing us now, of course, is: Now what? Police Chief
            Slayton informs me that no one has come forth with a legitimate
            claim on this tiger. He's consulted with the regional office of the
            U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to determine the fate of this tiger.
            It's not often that a tiger shows up in the United States,
            unclaimed. The Fish and Wildlife Service has no facility in which to
            keep it. After consultating with Police Chief Slayton, Fish and
            Wildlife has decided that the tiger should be donated to an
            organization which has both the facilities and the expertise to keep
            non-native animals. Your zoo, being accredited by the American
            Association of Zoos and Aquariums, would be such an organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know that you haven't any tigers at your zoo currently, nor
            perhaps a permanent outdoor exhibit area for a tiger. If you choose
            to keep this tiger, you'll have to design and build an appropriate
            exhibit which ensures both your tiger's health and visitors'
            education and enjoyment. I'd be happy to help you design this
            exhibit.

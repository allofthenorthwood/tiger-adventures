asked me to help you in your quest to identify and locate the missing tiger. I 
wish I could fly to San Gabriel today, but I'm afraid my schedule does not permit 
it.</P><P>Instead, I am sending you, in addition to my best wishes, a disk copy 
of my Tiger Handbook. There you'll find information about tiger behavior, tiger 
subspecies, and difference between subspecies. With this information, you should 
be able to identify the kind of tiger which has gone missing, and perhaps even 
where to find it.</P><P>You can also refer to the Handbook later, while you're 
examining the reports of tiger sightings.</P><P>I'm worried about this tiger, 
and the trouble it might cause. It was apparently so friendly at the airport that 
the customs officials were not afraid to open its cage. A truly wild tiger would 
have sent them running in fright. If this is a hand-raised tiger, it probably 
doesn't know how to hunt in the wild. It may well turn to people for food rather 
than wild prey. I'm afraid of the consequences, for both people and the tiger, 
if it comes to close to someone.</P><P>Keep me updated on your progress, and I'll 
help you stay on track. Good luck!</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="../handbook/handbook.htm" ><IMG SRC=

            Greetings! Police Chief Michael Slayton asked me to help you in your
            quest to identify and locate the missing tiger. I wish I could fly
            to San Gabriel today, but I'm afraid my schedule does not permit it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, I am sending you, in addition to my best wishes, a disk
            copy of my Tiger Handbook. There you'll find information about tiger
            behavior, tiger subspecies, and difference between subspecies. With
            this information, you should be able to identify the kind of tiger
            which has gone missing, and perhaps even where to find it.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also refer to the Handbook later, while you're examining the
            reports of tiger sightings.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm worried about this tiger, and the trouble it might cause. It was
            apparently so friendly at the airport that the customs officials
            were not afraid to open its cage. A truly wild tiger would have sent
            them running in fright. If this is a hand-raised tiger, it probably
            doesn't know how to hunt in the wild. It may well turn to people for
            food rather than wild prey. I'm afraid of the consequences, for both
            people and the tiger, if it comes to close to someone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep me updated on your progress, and I'll help you stay on track.
            Good luck!
          </p>

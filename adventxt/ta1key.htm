      1. Who are you? What's your job?
      <b>You're a zookeeper at the San Gabriel Zoo in New Mexico</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Where has the tiger escaped from?
      <b>From the airport customs office.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Julia Allende's report about the missing tiger includes a plaster cast
      of a pugmark (pawprint). Do you think this pugmark was made by the runaway
      tiger? Why or why not?
      <b
        >No -- the pugmark is too small to be from a tiger. It's probably from a
        mountain lion.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Clem Taylor's report included some fur from a wild animal. Do you think
      this fur was left by the runaway tiger? Why or why not?
      <b
        >Yes -- the fur looks like tiger fur, and a runaway tiger would be
        attracted to a cattle ranch.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Jason Cooper may have spotted the runaway tiger in a tree. Do you think
      his report is reliable evidence of the tiger's whereabouts? Why or why
      not?
      <b
        >No -- unlike domestic house cats, tigers don't climb trees, and they
        don't prey on small birds.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Danny Bence may have spotted the runaway tiger by the river. Do you
      think his report is reliable evidence of the tiger's whereabouts? Why or
      why not?
      <b
        >No -- tigers enjoy bathing in water and would not have hesitated to
        follow Danny into the river.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Victor Hernandez may have encountered the tiger at his ranch. Do you
      think his report is reliable evidence of the tiger's whereabouts? Why or
      why not?
      <b
        >No -- the Hernandez ranch is thirty miles away -- too far for the tiger
        to have traveled in five hours.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Where do you think Police Chief Slayton should concentrate his search
      for the runaway tiger? Why?
      <b
        >In the San Gabriel State Forest -- all the sightings have been near the
        forest. The tiger is probably hiding in the forest and making brief
        forays in search of food.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      9. After you learn the tiger's size and weight from Chief Slayton, what
      subspecies do you think the tiger is most likely to be? Why?<b>
        Sumatran, because the Sumatran tiger is more numerous than the extremely
        rare South China tiger.</b

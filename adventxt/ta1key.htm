Who are you? What's your job? <b>You're a zookeeper at the San Gabriel Zoo in 
New Mexico</b></p><p>2. Where has the tiger escaped from? <b>From the airport 
customs office.</b></p><p>3. Julia Allende's report about the missing tiger includes 
a plaster cast of a pugmark (pawprint). Do you think this pugmark was made by 
the runaway tiger? Why or why not? <b>No -- the pugmark is too small to be from 
a tiger. It's probably from a mountain lion.</b></p><p>4. Clem Taylor's report 
included some fur from a wild animal. Do you think this fur was left by the runaway 
tiger? Why or why not? <b>Yes -- the fur looks like tiger fur, and a runaway tiger 
would be attracted to a cattle ranch.</b></p><p>5. Jason Cooper may have spotted 
the runaway tiger in a tree. Do you think his report is reliable evidence of the 
tiger's whereabouts? Why or why not? <b>No -- unlike domestic house cats, tigers 
don't climb trees, and they don't prey on small birds.</b></p><p>6. Danny Bence 
may have spotted the runaway tiger by the river. Do you think his report is reliable 
evidence of the tiger's whereabouts? Why or why not? <b>No -- tigers enjoy bathing 
in water and would not have hesitated to follow Danny into the river.</b></p><p>7. 
Victor Hernandez may have encountered the tiger at his ranch. Do you think his 
report is reliable evidence of the tiger's whereabouts? Why or why not? <b>No 
-- the Hernandez ranch is thirty miles away -- too far for the tiger to have traveled 
in five hours.</b></p><p>8. Where do you think Police Chief Slayton should concentrate 
his search for the runaway tiger? Why? <b>In the San Gabriel State Forest -- all 
the sightings have been near the forest. The tiger is probably hiding in the forest 
and making brief forays in search of food.</b></p><p>9. After you learn the tiger's 
size and weight from Chief Slayton, what subspecies do you think the tiger is 
most likely to be? Why?<b> Sumatran, because the Sumatran tiger is more numerous 
than the extremely rare South China tiger.</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Back to <a HREF="ta1guide.htm">Tiger

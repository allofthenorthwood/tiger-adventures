            An important goal for zoos is to teach people about animals and the
            natural world. By giving visitors a good view of the tiger, zoos can
            help inspire them to learn and care about animals and nature. The
            zoo exhibit can't be too big, or people won't be able to see the
            tigers. And it can't be too small&#151;that would be unhealthy for
            the tiger, and many visitors would become upset to see the tiger
            locked up in such a way.

                  A good tiger exhibit is not too big and not too small. A zoo
                  tiger needs at least 30 meters by 50 meters (100 feet by 150
                  feet). That's about the size of two house lots. A large
                  exhibit would be about 80 meters by 150 meters (250 feet by
                  475 feet).

                  Visitors should be able to see the tiger when they come to the
                  zoo. The closer the better!

                  Some zoos have large spaces but keep the tigers in a smaller
                  area close to the visitors for good viewing. "Hot
                  wires" (harmless electric fences) keep the tiger in view.
                  An exhibit can seem larger and more natural without hiding the
                  tigers from view.

                  Zoos have to keep their wildlife and visitors safe. Some zoos
                  still use bars, but many zoos now try to build barriers of
                  wire, glass, or water which do not block visitors' views of
                  the animals.&nbsp;

                of the animals.

                  A tiger exhibit must also have night rooms for the tiger to
                  sleep in. Night rooms let zookeepers watch the tigers' health
                  closely and keep the tigers safe at night.

                its shoulder with the medicine. The tiger is freed before it

      <p>An important goal for zoos is to teach people about animals and the natural 
        world. By giving visitors a good view of the tiger, zoos can help inspire 
        them to learn and care about animals and nature. The zoo exhibit can't 
        be too big, or people won't be able to see the tigers. And it can't be 
        too small&#151;that would be unhealthy for the tiger, and many visitors 
        would become upset to see the tiger locked up in such a way.</p>

        <td COLSPAN="2"><p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font COLOR="#663300" SIZE="+1">A Home That's Just
        Right!</font></b></p>
            <p>A good tiger exhibit is not too big and not too small. A zoo tiger 
              needs at least 30 meters by 50 meters (100 feet by 150 feet). That's 
              about the size of two house lots. A large exhibit would be about 
              80 meters by 150 meters (250 feet by 475 feet).

        <p>Some zoos have large spaces but keep the tigers in a smaller area close to the visitors
        for good viewing. &quot;Hot wires&quot; (harmless electric fences) keep the tiger in view.
        An exhibit can seem larger and more natural without hiding the tigers from view.</td>

        <p>Zoos have to keep their wildlife and visitors safe. Some zoos still use bars, but many
        zoos now try to build barriers of wire, glass, or water which do not block visitors' views
        of the animals.&nbsp;</td>

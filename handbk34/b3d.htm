            /><b>Where Do They Live?</b><br />
            The Siberian (or Amur) tiger lives mostly in eastern Russia. A few
            are found in northeastern China and northern North Korea.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>How Many Are There?</b><br />
            In this century, the Siberian tiger has survived four wars, two
            revolutions, and now its forests are being cut down. It is estimated
            that about 430 Siberian tigers still exist in the wild, up from a
            few dozen in the 1940s. About 490 captive Siberian tigers are
            managed in zoo conservation programs, primarily in Europe (including
            Russia) and the U.S.A.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>What Do They Look Like?</b><br />
            Siberians are the largest tiger subspecies. The Siberian tiger's
            orange coloring is paler than all other tigers. Its stripes are
            brown rather than black, and are widely spaced compared to its
            southern cousins. It has a white chest and belly, and a thick white
            ruff of fur around its neck. In the winter, its coat grows long and
            shaggy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>How Big Are Siberian Tigers?</b><br />
            Male Siberian tigers grow up to 3.3 meters (10' 9") long.
            <br />
            Male Siberian tigers weigh up to 300 kilograms (660 pounds).<br />
            Females Siberian tigers are smaller, about 2.6 meters (8 1/2 feet)
            from head to tail. <br />
            Female Siberian tigers weigh about100 to 167 kilograms (200 to 370
            pounds).

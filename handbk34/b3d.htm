    Do They Live?</b><br>
    The Siberian (or Amur) tiger lives mostly in eastern Russia. A few are found in
    northeastern China and northern North Korea.</p>
    <p><b>How Many Are There?</b><br>
    In this century, the Siberian tiger has survived four wars, two revolutions, and now its
    forests are being cut down. It is estimated that about 430 Siberian tigers still exist in
    the wild, up from a few dozen in the 1940s. About 490 captive Siberian tigers are managed
    in zoo conservation programs, primarily in Europe (including Russia) and the U.S.A.</p>
    <p><b>What Do They Look Like?</b><br>
    Siberians are the largest tiger subspecies. The Siberian tiger's orange coloring is paler
    than all other tigers. Its stripes are brown rather than black, and are widely spaced
    compared to its southern cousins. It has a white chest and belly, and a thick white ruff
    of fur around its neck. In the winter, its coat grows long and shaggy.</p>
    <p><b>How Big Are Siberian Tigers?</b><br>
    Male Siberian tigers grow up to 3.3 meters (10' 9&quot;) long. <br>
    Male Siberian tigers weigh up to 300 kilograms (660 pounds).<br>
    Females Siberian tigers are smaller, about 2.6 meters (8 1/2 feet) from head to tail. <br>
    Female Siberian tigers weigh about100 to 167 kilograms (200 to 370 pounds).</p>

<p>Mr. Singh stood up and shook my hand. "Excellent," he said.
"Meet me here tonight at 6:00. And call me Sanjoy."</p>
<p>I was waiting under a banyan tree when Sanjoy puttered up in a
jeep shortly after six. "We're meeting a man named Ranjit," Sanjoy
explained once I was in the car. "He lives on the other side of the
forest reserve. Nobody there knows my face, so we'll be working
undercover. We've arranged to purchase several bags of tiger parts
from him."</p>
<p>"What should I do?"</p>
<p>Sanjoy cocked his head at me. "You'll be the foreign trader in
tiger parts." He swung a briefcase into my lap. "Open it."</p>
<p>I flipped the top up. Stacks of rupees filled the case.
Thousands of them. I whistled in amazement.</p>
<p>"Look closer," Sanjoy advised. I lifted one stack of rupees and
flipped through it. Except for the top few, all the bills were
actually blank paper.</p>
<p>After rattling along on the rough road for almost two hours,
Sanjoy slowed the jeep.</p>
<p>"We've nearly arrived. It could be dangerous. I can let you out
here if you like."</p>

<P>Mr. Singh stood up and shook my hand. "Excellent," he said.
"Meet me here tonight at 6:00. And call me Sanjoy."</P>

<P>I was waiting under a banyan tree when Sanjoy puttered up in a jeep shortly
after six. "We're meeting a man named Ranjit," Sanjoy explained
once I was in the car. "He lives on the other side of the forest reserve.
Nobody there knows my face, so we'll be working undercover. We've arranged
to purchase several bags of tiger parts from him."</P>

<P>"What should I do?"</P>

<P>Sanjoy cocked his head at me. "You'll be the foreign trader in tiger
parts." He swung a briefcase into my lap. "Open it."</P>

<P>I flipped the top up. Stacks of rupees filled the case. Thousands of
them. I whistled in amazement.</P>

<P>"Look closer," Sanjoy advised. I lifted one stack of rupees
and flipped through it. Except for the top few, all the bills were actually
blank paper.</P>

<P>After rattling along on the rough road for almost two hours, Sanjoy slowed
the jeep.</P>

<P>"We've nearly arrived. It could be dangerous. I can let you out
here if you like."</P>

<P>Mr. Singh stood up and shook my hand. &quot;Excellent,&quot; he said.
&quot;Meet me here tonight at 6:00. And call me Sanjoy.&quot;</P>

<P>I was waiting under a banyan tree when Sanjoy puttered up in a jeep shortly
after six. &quot;We're meeting a man named Ranjit,&quot; Sanjoy explained
once I was in the car. &quot;He lives on the other side of the forest reserve.
Nobody there knows my face, so we'll be working undercover. We've arranged
to purchase several bags of tiger parts from him.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What should I do?&quot;</P>

<P>Sanjoy cocked his head at me. &quot;You'll be the foreign trader in tiger
parts.&quot; He swung a briefcase into my lap. &quot;Open it.&quot;</P>

<P>I flipped the top up. Stacks of rupees filled the case. Thousands of
them. I whistled in amazement.</P>

<P>&quot;Look closer,&quot; Sanjoy advised. I lifted one stack of rupees
and flipped through it. Except for the top few, all the bills were actually
blank paper.</P>

<P>After rattling along on the rough road for almost two hours, Sanjoy slowed
the jeep.</P>

<P>&quot;We've nearly arrived. It could be dangerous. I can let you out
here if you like.&quot;</P>

    <p>
      <b>What is it?</b> "Tracking the Tiger Trade" is an online
      interactive adventure designed to teach about threats facing wild tigers
      today, specifically poaching, the trade in tiger parts, and the use of
      tiger parts in traditional Chinese medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Scene:</b> You are a journalist sent to India to investigate tiger
      poaching. You go undercover with an Indian Forest officer to catch two
      tiger poachers. You then follow the tiger trade into Tibet to the final
      market in China. It concludes with suggestions for ways to help save
      tigers from poaching. One suggestion is to write an article about the
      tiger trade. You can use this as a class or individual assignment to teach
      research and writing skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Who Can Play? </b>Students can play independently or in small groups.
      You could also project it on a screen for a whole class activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tracking the Tiger Trade" is written for fifth grade and older.
      There is a fair amount of text in the narrative.

      Handbook also challenges players to consider the role of zoos in our
      society as well as how to balance the needs of the animals with the
      desires of the public.

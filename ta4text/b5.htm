<P>Mr. Singh smiled. &quot;That's correct. Maybe you do know something about
tigers. Well, then. What would you like to know?&quot;</P>

&quot;How serious is tiger poaching? Will it drive the tiger to extinction?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I certainly hope not!&quot; Mr. Singh replied. &quot;Not if my
men and I have anything to say about it!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What are you doing to stop the poaching?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's difficult work,&quot; Mr. Singh explained. &quot;But my men
are the best. You would not believe what they are up against.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Tell me,&quot; I said, jotting notes furiously.</P>

<P>&quot;Two of my rangers have been murdered in the past three years. The
rest of us do not always receive our pay. The poachers constantly try to
bribe us. Sometimes the state government keeps funds that the central government
has designated for tiger protection.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Yet we do not
give up. We must protect the tiger.&quot;</P>

<P>I paused only briefly from my note-taking. &quot;Tell me what you're
doing. How do you catch poachers?&quot;</P>

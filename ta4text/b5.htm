<p>Mr. Singh smiled. "That's correct. Maybe you do know something
about tigers. Well, then. What would you like to know?"</p>

my reporter's notebook. "How serious is tiger poaching? Will it
drive the tiger to extinction?"</p>
<p>"I certainly hope not!" Mr. Singh replied. "Not if my men and I
have anything to say about it!"</p>
<p>"What are you doing to stop the poaching?"</p>
<p>"It's difficult work," Mr. Singh explained. "But my men are the
best. You would not believe what they are up against."</p>
<p>"Tell me," I said, jotting notes furiously.</p>
<p>"Two of my rangers have been murdered in the past three years.
The rest of us do not always receive our pay. The poachers
constantly try to bribe us. Sometimes the state government keeps
funds that the central government has designated for tiger
protection." He sighed. "Yet we do not give up. We must protect the
tiger."</p>
<p>I paused only briefly from my note-taking. "Tell me what you're
doing. How do you catch poachers?"</p>

to <a href="b7.htm">show you?</a>"</p>

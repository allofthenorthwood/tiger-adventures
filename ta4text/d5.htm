<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the pharmacist and handed me a bottle of asprin.</P>

<P>&quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;I've tried every painkiller. I was hoping
you could recommend something more...traditional.&quot;</P>

NATURALSIZEFLAG=" ALT="Tiger parts for sale" 3">The pharmacist sized me up,
then said briskly, &quot;I have a very good medicine for back pain.&quot;
He reached up and selected a jar from the shelf. &quot;Take several of these
pills. They will make the pain go away.&quot;</P>

<P>I looked at the label, which was in Mandarin Chinese. &quot;What is it?&quot;
I asked.</P>

<P>The pharmacist gave me a confiding wink. &quot;Tiger bones. There is
nothing better for back pain.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Thanks,&quot; I said. &quot;Are these pills good for anything else?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, certainly,&quot; the pharmacist said. &quot;They are very
powerful. They will calm the nerves, strengthen your bones, increase your
intelligence, cure dysentery, even improve your memory.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sounds great,&quot; I said, astonished.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../ta4graph/tigmeds.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="174" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10 
NATURALSIZEFLAG=" ALT="Tiger medicines" 3">&quot;Yes, it is an excellent medicine. And if you do not like to take
pills, I can give you tiger bone in other forms. I have wine and soups made
from tiger bone. Would you like to see them?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No thanks,&quot; I said. I had seen and heard enough for one day.</P>

<P>So this was the end of the trail. Even though I had followed the tiger
trade from poor Indian poachers to Chinese pharmacies, I did not feel happy
or triumphant.</P>

<P>Sanjoy Singh and I had managed to put two poachers behind bars, but there
was no guarantee they would stay there, and even if they did, other poachers
would soon take their place. Selling tiger parts was simply too lucrative
for some people to pass up.</P>

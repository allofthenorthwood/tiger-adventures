          <p>"Yes," said the pharmacist and handed me a bottle of asprin.</p>
          <p>
            "No," I said. "I've tried every painkiller. I was hoping you could
            recommend something more...traditional."
          </p>

            />The pharmacist sized me up, then said briskly, "I have a very good
            medicine for back pain." He reached up and selected a jar from the
            shelf. "Take several of these pills. They will make the pain go
            away."
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked at the label, which was in Mandarin Chinese. "What is it?"
            I asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pharmacist gave me a confiding wink. "Tiger bones. There is
            nothing better for back pain."
          </p>
          <p>"Thanks," I said. "Are these pills good for anything else?"</p>
          <p>
            "Yes, certainly," the pharmacist said. "They are very powerful. They
            will calm the nerves, strengthen your bones, increase your
            intelligence, cure dysentery, even improve your memory."
          </p>
          <p>"Sounds great," I said, astonished.</p>
          <p>
            <img

              alt="Tiger medicines"
            />"Yes, it is an excellent medicine. And if you do not like to take
            pills, I can give you tiger bone in other forms. I have wine and
            soups made from tiger bone. Would you like to see them?"
          </p>
          <p>"No thanks," I said. I had seen and heard enough for one day.</p>
          <p>
            So this was the end of the trail. Even though I had followed the
            tiger trade from poor Indian poachers to Chinese pharmacies, I did
            not feel happy or triumphant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sanjoy Singh and I had managed to put two poachers behind bars, but
            there was no guarantee they would stay there, and even if they did,
            other poachers would soon take their place. Selling tiger parts was
            simply too lucrative for some people to pass up.

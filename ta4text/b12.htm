frowned, still not sure whether he could trust me. He glanced forward at Sanjoy 
just as we turned into the police station.<p>&quot;Betrayer!&quot; he cried. He 
pulled out a crude gun and waved it at me and Sanjoy. Gopal, shouting, pulled 
out a stubby rifle from beneath the folds of his clothing. I shouted back at Ranjit 
and Gopal, but I had nothing to defend myself with.</p><p>Four police officers 
had been waiting for us. They dragged Ranjit and Gopal out and slapped handcuffs 
around their wrists. Two led the poachers into the station.</p><p>Sanjoy swung 
open the trunk and pulled out the burlap sack. &quot;Here is the evidence,&quot; 
he declared. &quot;Two tiger skins.&quot;</p><p><img SRC="../ta4graph/skins2.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Police with tiger skins" WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="212">The 
policemen examined the skins and then turned to us. &quot;You know you are crazy 
people,&quot; one told us. &quot;Even we police cannot go into the neighborhoods 
where these men live. It is very dangerous.&quot;</p><p>Sanjoy slapped me on the 
back. &quot;Yes, I was also worried for a moment.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm sorry 
if I endangered the operation,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm used to asking questions, 
not holding my tongue.&quot;</p><p>I sighed as the excitement of the evening caught 
up with me. I told Sanjoy, &quot;This whole adventure has worn me out.</p>

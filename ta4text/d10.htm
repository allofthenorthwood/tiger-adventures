<P>"There are some good projects happening in Asia," Dr. Tiger
said. "Support them by sending money, if you can. If you can't send
money, write them a letter saying how much you appreciate the work they're
doing. (But don't ask for them to write you back--they've got too much to
do already!)</P>

        <P>"For example, <A HREF="../../trouble/ConservationOrganizations/Descriptions/WPSI.htm">The 
          Wildlife Protection Society of India</A> is recognised as the premier 
          non-goverment investigation agency working against tiger poachers and 
          traders. It gathers information and works with enforcement authorities 
          to apprehend wildlife criminals. It aims to avert the Indian wildlife 
          crisis through investigation and enforcement, legal support, education 
          and training, and research.</P>

projects in India that strengthen the front line in tiger conservation and
protection by providing much needed equipment and NGO (non-government organisation)
expertise to the forest guards.</P>

<P>"Also, the TigerLink Awards recognize unsung heroes in India who
have gone above and beyond the call of duty in their efforts to stop poaching
and save the tiger. Follow the lead of the Tiger Information Center, which
recently sponsored a <A HREF="../../trouble/ConservationOrganizations/linkmtg.htm">TigerLink Award</A>, by sending
your own donation.</P>

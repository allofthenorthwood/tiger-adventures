<p>"There are some good projects happening in Asia," Dr. Tiger
said. "Support them by sending money, if you can. If you can't send
money, write them a letter saying how much you appreciate the work
they're doing. (But don't ask for them to write you back--they've
got too much to do already!)</p>
<p>"For example, <a href=
"../../trouble/ConservationOrganizations/Descriptions/WPSI.htm">The
Wildlife Protection Society of India</a> is recognised as the
premier non-goverment investigation agency working against tiger
poachers and traders. It gathers information and works with
enforcement authorities to apprehend wildlife criminals. It aims to
avert the Indian wildlife crisis through investigation and
enforcement, legal support, education and training, and
research.</p>

"../../trouble/ConservationOrganizations/21stCT/21st.htm">Global
Tiger Patrol</a> funds projects in India that strengthen the front
line in tiger conservation and protection by providing much needed
equipment and NGO (non-government organisation) expertise to the
forest guards.</p>
<p>"Also, the TigerLink Awards recognize unsung heroes in India who
have gone above and beyond the call of duty in their efforts to
stop poaching and save the tiger. Follow the lead of the Tiger
Information Center, which recently sponsored a <a href=
"../../trouble/ConservationOrganizations/linkmtg.htm">TigerLink
Award</a>, by sending your own donation.</p>

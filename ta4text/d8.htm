<p>On my return home, I called Dr. Tiger and asked, "How can the
tiger trade be stopped?"</p>
<p><img src="../ta4graph/drtiger.jpg" width="60" height="77" align=
"right" naturalsizeflag="3">He said, "Banning the use of tiger
parts in medicine is a good start. Unfortunately, it doesn't solve
the problem. Such bans have already been imposed in almost all
Asian countries, but they have not stopped the trade.</p>
<p>"There are new synthetic alternatives to tiger medicines," he
added. "We hope that people will switch to these once they
understand that, chemically, the synthetic medicines are identical
to what they've been using for centuries."</p>
<p>"Is that all?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I've heard about other schemes. Some people have proposed
breeding tigers on farms specifically to harvest their bones and
other parts for medicines. These 'tiger farms,' however, have
proved unprofitable. It's much cheaper to buy parts of a poached
tiger than raise a tiger from birth. Another suggestion has been to
develop a tiger hunting program, but tiger populations are much too
endangered to risk such a thing."</p>
<p><a name="help"></a>"So what can we do?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Write your article," he said. "See if your school newspaper or
the newsletter at your job or church will print it."</p>
<p><a href="../handbook/e1.htm"><img src="../ta4graph/pda2.jpg"
width="100" height="56" align="right" naturalsizeflag="3" alt=
"Tiger Handbook" border="0"></a>"<a href="../handbook/e1.htm">Learn
more</a> about the threats facing tigers, then tell people about
them. The more people who know about the tiger's dire predicament,
the more luck we'll have working to save the tiger."</p>
<p>"You can also join Bittu Sahgal's Cub and Sanctuary Magazine,
and read the <a href=
"../../Kids/trouble/BittuS/Updates/bittu1.htm">letters he's
written</a> to kids about tigers in India</p>
<p>"And <a href="../../trouble/helping.htm">learn about ways</a>
that kids are helping to save tigers. Write a letter, collect
signatures on a petition, have a bake sale...there are lots of
things you can do!</p>
<p>"Okay," I said. "What else?"</p>
<p>"Some people in Asia are doing <a href="d10.htm">good work</a>
to stop poaching. Support them.</p>
<p>"Or <a href="d11.htm">write President Bill Clinton and
Vice-President Al Gore."</a></p>
<p>Dr. Tiger had given me a lot of suggestions about what I could
do to help stop poaching. It sounded like a lot of work--but it
would be worth it. Time to get to work.</p>

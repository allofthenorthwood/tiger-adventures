<P>On my return home, I called Dr. Tiger and asked, &quot;How can the tiger
trade be stopped?&quot;</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../ta4graph/drtiger.jpg" WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="77" ALIGN="RIGHT"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">He said, &quot;Banning the use of tiger parts in medicine
is a good start. Unfortunately, it doesn't solve the problem. Such bans
have already been imposed in almost all Asian countries, but they have not
stopped the trade.</P>

<P>&quot;There are new synthetic alternatives to tiger medicines,&quot;
he added. &quot;We hope that people will switch to these once they understand
that, chemically, the synthetic medicines are identical to what they've
been using for centuries.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Is that all?&quot; I asked.</P>

<P>&quot;I've heard about other schemes. Some people have proposed breeding
tigers on farms specifically to harvest their bones and other parts for
medicines. These 'tiger farms,' however, have proved unprofitable. It's
much cheaper to buy parts of a poached tiger than raise a tiger from birth.
Another suggestion has been to develop a tiger hunting program, but tiger
populations are much too endangered to risk such a thing.&quot;</P>

<P><A NAME="help"></A>&quot;So what can we do?&quot; I asked him.</P>

        <P>&quot;Write your article,&quot; he said. &quot;See if your school newspaper 
          or the newsletter at your job or church will print it.&quot;</P>

<P><A HREF="../handbook/e1.htm" ><IMG SRC="../ta4graph/pda2.jpg"
WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="56" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Tiger Handbook"
BORDER="0"></A>&quot;<A HREF="../handbook/e1.htm">Learn more</A> about the
threats facing tigers, then tell people about them. The more people who
know about the tiger's dire predicament, the more luck we'll have working
to save the tiger.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You can also join Bittu Sahgal's Cub and Sanctuary Magazine, and
read the <A HREF="../../Kids/trouble/BittuS/Updates/bittu1.htm">letters he's written</A> to kids about
tigers in India </P>

        <P>&quot;And <A HREF="../../trouble/helping.htm">learn about ways</A> that 
          kids are helping to save tigers. Write a letter, collect signatures 
          on a petition, have a bake sale...there are lots of things you can do!</P>

<P>&quot;Okay,&quot; I said. &quot;What else?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Some people in Asia are doing <A HREF="d10.htm">good work</A> to
stop poaching. Support them.</P>

<P>&quot;Or <A HREF="d11.htm">write President Bill Clinton and Vice-President
Al Gore.&quot;</A></P>

<P>Dr. Tiger had given me a lot of suggestions about what I could do to
help stop poaching. It sounded like a lot of work--but it would be worth
it. Time to get to work.</TD></TR>

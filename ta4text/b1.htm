of India. That evening I walked through the heart of the old city, sucking
in the rich smells. Incense, curry, cow dung...I'd missed them all.</P>

<P>I took a train to the Royal Bengal Tiger Preserve, several hours from
Delhi, where the tiger in the leg trap was found. At the Forest Headquarters,
I found the office for an S.M. Singh, the Field Director and a friend of
Dr. Tiger's.</P>

<P>Mr. Singh's office was a dusty room with ceiling fans circling lazily
above several desks. Paper--various reports, correspondence and files--was
stacked high on his desk.</P>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Mr. Singh">"Namaste," I said politely.
That means "Hello" in Hindi.</P>

<P>"What can I do for you?" he replied in English.</P>

<P>I introduced myself and added, "Dr. Tiger sent me to write an article
about tiger poaching."</P>

<P>Mr. Singh cocked his head. "Yes, Dr. Tiger told me to expect you.
Are you an expert on tigers?"</P>

<P>"I know a little about them," I admitted.</P>

<P>"Is that so?" he replied. A smile played on his lips. "Tell
me, then--in what parts of the world do tigers live?"</TD></TR>

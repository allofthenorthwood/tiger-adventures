in New Delhi, the capital of India. That evening I walked through
the heart of the old city, sucking in the rich smells. Incense,
curry, cow dung...I'd missed them all.</p>
<p>I took a train to the Royal Bengal Tiger Preserve, several hours
from Delhi, where the tiger in the leg trap was found. At the
Forest Headquarters, I found the office for an S.M. Singh, the
Field Director and a friend of Dr. Tiger's.</p>
<p>Mr. Singh's office was a dusty room with ceiling fans circling
lazily above several desks. Paper--various reports, correspondence
and files--was stacked high on his desk.</p>
<p><img src="../ta4graph/singh.jpg" width="120" height="151" align=
"right" naturalsizeflag="3" alt="Mr. Singh">"Namaste," I said
politely. That means "Hello" in Hindi.</p>
<p>"What can I do for you?" he replied in English.</p>
<p>I introduced myself and added, "Dr. Tiger sent me to write an
article about tiger poaching."</p>
<p>Mr. Singh cocked his head. "Yes, Dr. Tiger told me to expect
you. Are you an expert on tigers?"</p>
<p>"I know a little about them," I admitted.</p>
<p>"Is that so?" he replied. A smile played on his lips. "Tell me,
then--in what parts of the world do tigers live?"</p>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="New Delhi street">We landed in New Delhi, the capital
of India. That evening I walked through the heart of the old city, sucking
in the rich smells. Incense, curry, cow dung...I'd missed them all.</P>

<P>I took a train to the Royal Bengal Tiger Preserve, several hours from
Delhi, where the tiger in the leg trap was found. At the Forest Headquarters,
I found the office for an S.M. Singh, the Field Director and a friend of
Dr. Tiger's.</P>

<P>Mr. Singh's office was a dusty room with ceiling fans circling lazily
above several desks. Paper--various reports, correspondence and files--was
stacked high on his desk.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../ta4graph/singh.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="151" ALIGN="RIGHT"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Mr. Singh">&quot;Namaste,&quot; I said politely.
That means &quot;Hello&quot; in Hindi.</P>

<P>&quot;What can I do for you?&quot; he replied in English.</P>

<P>I introduced myself and added, &quot;Dr. Tiger sent me to write an article
about tiger poaching.&quot;</P>

<P>Mr. Singh cocked his head. &quot;Yes, Dr. Tiger told me to expect you.
Are you an expert on tigers?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I know a little about them,&quot; I admitted.</P>

<P>&quot;Is that so?&quot; he replied. A smile played on his lips. &quot;Tell
me, then--in what parts of the world do tigers live?&quot;</TD></TR>

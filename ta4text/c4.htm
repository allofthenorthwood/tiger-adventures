to Lhasa. The flight over the Himalaya Mountains was pretty rough. I was
glad I had skipped breakfast.</P>

<P>The views were incredible, but they made me dizzy. To distract myself,
I looked at Dr. Tiger's fact sheet about Tibet:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#333333">Tibet is often called the "Roof of the World,"
  since it is located on the world's highest plateau. Most of Tibet lies
  more than 12,000 feet above sea level. Tibet was once the most geographically
  isolated country in the world. In 1959 Tibet lost its independence when
  China took control and renamed it Xizang (sit-sang). Many Tibetans still
  resist Chinese control, but resistance becomes more difficult as China
  strengthens its economic links with Tibet.</FONT></P>

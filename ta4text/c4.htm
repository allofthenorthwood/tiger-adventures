next airplane to Lhasa. The flight over the Himalaya Mountains was
pretty rough. I was glad I had skipped breakfast.</p>
<p>The views were incredible, but they made me dizzy. To distract
myself, I looked at Dr. Tiger's fact sheet about Tibet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#333333">Tibet is often called the "Roof of the
World," since it is located on the world's highest plateau. Most of
Tibet lies more than 12,000 feet above sea level. Tibet was once
the most geographically isolated country in the world. In 1959
Tibet lost its independence when China took control and renamed it
Xizang (sit-sang). Many Tibetans still resist Chinese control, but
resistance becomes more difficult as China strengthens its economic
links with Tibet.</font></p>

capital of Tibet, I took a cab into town. I asked the cab driver,
"I'm looking for a merchant named Tsering Dolkan. <a href=

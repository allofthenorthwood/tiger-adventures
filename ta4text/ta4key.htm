    <p>
      1. Who are you?
      <b>What's your job? You're a journalist who spent ten years in India.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Why do you go to India?
      <b
        >Because Dr. Tiger (Dr. Laohu) asks you to investigate the tiger trade
        and write an article that will raise public awareness about it.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Who do you meet in India?
      <b
        >Mr. Sanjoy Singh, a Forest Service officer. He quizzes you on some
        basic tiger knowledge to make sure you know something about tigers, then
        invites you to join him on an undercover mission to arrest two tiger
        poachers.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      4. How do the poachers kill tigers?
      <b
        >With steel traps, or by poisoning dead animals or pools of water, thus
        poisoning any tigers that come to eat or drink.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Why do the poachers kill tigers?
      <b
        >As one poacher says: "Tigers are not the romantic creatures that you
        foreigners think they are. They attack and kill our cattle, our goats,
        even our children sometimes. Gopal must protect his family from these
        predators. And he must earn money to support his family."</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Where do you go after capturing the poachers?
      <b>To Tibet, to follow the trade in tiger bones.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      6. What does the Tibetan merchant offer you in exchange for tiger bones?
      <b
        >Shahtoosh, the king of wool, made from the Tibetan Antelope, the Chiru,
        which is an endangered species. Shawls made from shahtoosh sell for more
        than two thousand dollars in Europe.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Where do you go to find the final destination for the tiger bones?
      <b>Beijing, China.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      8. What are tiger bones used for?
      <b
        >Since ancient times, Chinese medical texts have recommended tiger bone
        as a cure for joint pain and stiffness, back pain, rheumatism, and
        muscle spasms. Ancient Chinese texts also recommended various other
        tiger body parts as the cure for many illnesses and health concerns.
        According to these traditions, tiger eyes improve your vision. Tiger
        whiskers cure toothaches. Tiger penises make tigers of men. These
        beliefs are deeply embedded in Chinese culture and cannot be changed
        quickly or easily.</b

for Tracking the Tiger Trade Adventure<br> on the Tiger Information Center's web 
site (www.5tigers.org)</b></p><p>1. Who are you? <b>What's your job? You're a 
journalist who spent ten years in India.</b></p><p>2. Why do you go to India? 
<b>Because Dr. Tiger (Dr. Laohu) asks you to investigate the tiger trade and write 
an article that will raise public awareness about it.</b></p><p>3. Who do you 
meet in India? <b>Mr. Sanjoy Singh, a Forest Service officer. He quizzes you on 
some basic tiger knowledge to make sure you know something about tigers, then 
invites you to join him on an undercover mission to arrest two tiger poachers.</b></p><p>4. 
How do the poachers kill tigers? <b>With steel traps, or by poisoning dead animals 
or pools of water, thus poisoning any tigers that come to eat or drink.</b></p><p>5. 
Why do the poachers kill tigers? <b>As one poacher says: &quot;Tigers are not 
the romantic creatures that you foreigners think they are. They attack and kill 
our cattle, our goats, even our children sometimes. Gopal must protect his family 
from these predators. And he must earn money to support his family.&quot;</b></p><p>5. 
Where do you go after capturing the poachers? <b>To Tibet, to follow the trade 
in tiger bones.</b></p><p>6. What does the Tibetan merchant offer you in exchange 
for tiger bones? <b>Shahtoosh, the king of wool, made from the Tibetan Antelope, 
the Chiru, which is an endangered species. Shawls made from shahtoosh sell for 
more than two thousand dollars in Europe.</b></p><p>7. Where do you go to find 
the final destination for the tiger bones? <b>Beijing, China.</b></p><p>8. What 
are tiger bones used for? <b>Since ancient times, Chinese medical texts have recommended 
tiger bone as a cure for joint pain and stiffness, back pain, rheumatism, and 
muscle spasms. Ancient Chinese texts also recommended various other tiger body 
parts as the cure for many illnesses and health concerns. According to these traditions, 
tiger eyes improve your vision. Tiger whiskers cure toothaches. Tiger penises 
make tigers of men. These beliefs are deeply embedded in Chinese culture and cannot 
be changed quickly or easily.</b></p><p>Back to <a HREF="ta4guide.htm">Tracking

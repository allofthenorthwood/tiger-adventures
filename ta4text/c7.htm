<P>&quot;I know her,&quot; said the cab driver.</P>

<P>Tsering's shop was a dark hole in a wall on a quiet street. &quot;Good
afternoon,&quot; she said. &quot;Can I help you?&quot;</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../ta4graph/tsering.jpg" WIDTH="110" HEIGHT="135" ALIGN="LEFT"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Maybe my adventure with Sanjoy should have taught me
better, but I decided to continue my research in the same spirit of subterfuge.
&quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;I've got some tiger bones to sell.&quot;</P>

<P>Tsering looked suspicious. &quot;Tiger bones?&quot; She frowned. Perhaps
it was uncommon for someone like me to be involved in the tiger trade. Oh
well--it was too late to change my story now. &quot;How many?&quot; she
asked.</P>

<P>&quot;A boxful,&quot; I said vaguely. &quot;They're at my hotel.&quot;</P>

<P>Tsering nodded slowly. &quot;I
can offer you an excellent deal. I will trade you one pound of shahtoosh
wool for three and a half pounds of tiger bone.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Shahtoosh?&quot; I asked. &quot;What's that?&quot;</P>

<P>She looked suprised. &quot;Shahtoosh is the king of wool,&quot; she explained.
&quot;It's made from our very own Tibetan Antelope, the Chiru, a very rare
animal even in Tibet. With this wool, you can make a wool shawl that will
sell for more than two thousand dollars in Europe.&quot;</P>

the chiru toward extinction.</P>

<P>But why were shahtoosh shawls so valuable? <A HREF="c9.htm">&quot;Why
are they worth so much?&quot;</A> I asked.</TD></TR>

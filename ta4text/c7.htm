<p>Tsering's shop was a dark hole in a wall on a quiet street.
"Good afternoon," she said. "Can I help you?"</p>

align="left" naturalsizeflag="3">Maybe my adventure with Sanjoy
should have taught me better, but I decided to continue my research
in the same spirit of subterfuge. "Yes," I said. "I've got some
tiger bones to sell."</p>
<p>Tsering looked suspicious. "Tiger bones?" She frowned. Perhaps
it was uncommon for someone like me to be involved in the tiger
trade. Oh well--it was too late to change my story now. "How many?"
she asked.</p>
<p>"A boxful," I said vaguely. "They're at my hotel."</p>
<p>Tsering nodded slowly. "I can offer you an excellent deal. I
will trade you one pound of shahtoosh wool for three and a half
pounds of tiger bone."</p>
<p>"Shahtoosh?" I asked. "What's that?"</p>
<p>She looked suprised. "Shahtoosh is the king of wool," she
explained. "It's made from our very own Tibetan Antelope, the
Chiru, a very rare animal even in Tibet. With this wool, you can
make a wool shawl that will sell for more than two thousand dollars
in Europe."</p>

driving both the tiger and the chiru toward extinction.</p>
<p>But why were shahtoosh shawls so valuable? <a href="c9.htm">"Why
are they worth so much?"</a> I asked.</p>

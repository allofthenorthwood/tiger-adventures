<P>"I know her," said the cab driver.</P>

<P>Tsering's shop was a dark hole in a wall on a quiet street. "Good
afternoon," she said. "Can I help you?"</P>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Maybe my adventure with Sanjoy should have taught me
better, but I decided to continue my research in the same spirit of subterfuge.
"Yes," I said. "I've got some tiger bones to sell."</P>

<P>Tsering looked suspicious. "Tiger bones?" She frowned. Perhaps
it was uncommon for someone like me to be involved in the tiger trade. Oh
well--it was too late to change my story now. "How many?" she
asked.</P>

<P>"A boxful," I said vaguely. "They're at my hotel."</P>

<P>Tsering nodded slowly. "I
can offer you an excellent deal. I will trade you one pound of shahtoosh
wool for three and a half pounds of tiger bone."</P>

<P>"Shahtoosh?" I asked. "What's that?"</P>

<P>She looked suprised. "Shahtoosh is the king of wool," she explained.
"It's made from our very own Tibetan Antelope, the Chiru, a very rare
animal even in Tibet. With this wool, you can make a wool shawl that will
sell for more than two thousand dollars in Europe."</P>

the chiru toward extinction.</P>

<P>But why were shahtoosh shawls so valuable? <A HREF="c9.htm">"Why
are they worth so much?"</A> I asked.</TD></TR>

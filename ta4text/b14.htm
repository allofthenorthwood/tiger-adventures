You have nothing to worry about. There is no danger from the government. They 
are incompetent and corrupt. A small bribe here and there takes care of any problems."<p>Sanjoy's 
jaw tightened, but he said nothing. I smiled privately. Sanjoy was one Forest 
Service ranger who couldn't be bribed. I was confident that there were many more.</p><p>As 
proof, I saw four police officers waiting outside their station as Sanjoy turned 
up the drive.</p><p><img SRC="../ta4graph/gun2.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Ranjit's gun" WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="79">"Betrayer!"

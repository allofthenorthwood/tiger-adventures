<td colspan="2"><basefont size="4">Ranjit laughed. "Crack down on
poaching? You have nothing to worry about. There is no danger from
the government. They are incompetent and corrupt. A small bribe
here and there takes care of any problems."
<p>Sanjoy's jaw tightened, but he said nothing. I smiled privately.
Sanjoy was one Forest Service ranger who couldn't be bribed. I was
confident that there were many more.</p>
<p>As proof, I saw four police officers waiting outside their
station as Sanjoy turned up the drive.</p>
<p><img src="../ta4graph/gun2.gif" align="left" naturalsizeflag="3"

cried. He pulled out his crude gun and waved it at me and Sanjoy.
Gopal, shouting, pulled out a stubby rifle from beneath the folds
of his clothing. I shouted back at Ranjit and Gopal, but I had
nothing to defend myself with.</p>
<p>The police officers wasted no time. They dragged Ranjit and
Gopal out and slapped handcuffs around their wrists. Two led the
poachers into the station.</p>
<p>Sanjoy swung open the trunk and showed the rest of us the burlap
sack. "Here is the evidence," he declared. "Two tiger skins."</p>

policemen examined the skins and then turned to us. "You know you
are crazy people," one told us. "Even we police cannot go into the
neighborhoods where these men live. It is very dangerous."</p>
<p>Sanjoy slapped me on the back. "Yes, I was also worried for a
moment."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry if I endangered the operation," I said. "I'm used to
asking questions, not holding my tongue."</p>
<p>I sighed as the excitement of the evening caught up with me. I
told Sanjoy, "This whole adventure has worn me out.</p>

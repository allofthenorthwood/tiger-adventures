<P>Mr. Singh was still sitting at his desk. The stacks of paper on his desk
seemed taller than ever.</P>

<P>"Namaste," I said politely.</P>

<P>Mr. Singh looked up from his work and sighed. "You again,"
he replied in English.</P>

<P>"I've been studying," I explained. "I think you'll be
impressed."</P>

<P>He folded his hands and looked at me for a moment. "Very well.</P>

<P>"Is that so?" he replied. A smile played on his lips. "Tell
me, then--how much can a trader earn from the sale of the bones from a tiger?"</P>

<P>"That's easy," I said.</P>

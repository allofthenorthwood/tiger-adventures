<P>Mr. Singh was still sitting at his desk. The stacks of paper on his desk
seemed taller than ever.</P>

<P>&quot;Namaste,&quot; I said politely.</P>

<P>Mr. Singh looked up from his work and sighed. &quot;You again,&quot;
he replied in English.</P>

<P>&quot;I've been studying,&quot; I explained. &quot;I think you'll be
impressed.&quot;</P>

<P>He folded his hands and looked at me for a moment. &quot;Very well.</P>

<P>&quot;Is that so?&quot; he replied. A smile played on his lips. &quot;Tell
me, then--how much can a trader earn from the sale of the bones from a tiger?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's easy,&quot; I said.</P>

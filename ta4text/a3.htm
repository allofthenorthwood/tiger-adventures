put me on the first plane to India. He also sent me a digital Tiger
Handbook. "For field info," he explained. "Feel free to consult it
whenever necessary."</p>
<p>He also gave me a few fact sheets about the countries I would be
visiting. While flying over the Atlantic Ocean, I read the sheet
about India.</p>

and population. It is home to 952 million people and several
thousand Bengal tigers--India's national symbol. Many people live
in rural areas--often near forests where tigers live. Because of
that, there are often conflicts between people and
tigers.</font></p>

livestock. Others kill tigers for their body parts. Traders pay
poachers 2000 rupees (US$56) for a dead tiger. That's almost half

the tiger skin for 50,000 to 80,000 rupees (US$1,390 to US$2,220),
and the bones for up to 120,000 rupees (US$3,330). Such tiger
poaching is one of the gravest threats facing wild tigers
today.</font> <font color="#FFFFFF">See the</font> <a href=

<p>I shivered with fear and excitement. Dr. Tiger had sent me on
the trail of tiger poachers! When I'd been in India fifteen years
ago, poaching was rare and tiger populations were well protected.
But things had changed since then. Nowadays, it's estimated that
one tiger is poached in India <i>every day</i>.</p>
<p>Researching tiger poaching would be a dangerous business. For a

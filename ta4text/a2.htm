voice on the phone was crisp and wide awake. "This is Dr. Laohu. Do
you know who I am?"</p>
<p>"Of course," I said. "You're that famous tiger researcher at the
Vancouver Zoo. Most people call you Dr. Tiger 'cause your
name--Laohu--means tiger in Chinese."</p>
<p>Dr. Tiger chuckled. "You're not as sleepy as you sound. I'm
sending you a fax right now. Do you see it?"</p>

leg trap?"</p>
<p>"That's right," said Dr. Tiger. "That tiger lives in Royal
Bengal Tiger Reserve in India. Two days ago, a Forest Service field
officer found this tiger in the trap. We need to tell the world
what's going on there. And you're just the journalist to do

<p>"You know your way around India. You speak Hindi. And you'll do
anything to help save the tiger. Am I right?"</p>
<p>I frowned. He was right. But was I up to the job? I'd spent ten
years as a journalist in India, photographing tigers in my spare
time. When I left to pursue other assignments, I figured I'd be
back soon. But I never returned to India--except in my dreams.</p>

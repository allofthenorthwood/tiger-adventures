voice on the phone was crisp and wide awake. "This is Dr. Laohu. Do you know 
who I am?"</p><p>"Of course," I said. "You're that famous 
tiger researcher at the Vancouver Zoo. Most people call you Dr. Tiger 'cause your 
name--Laohu--means tiger in Chinese."</p><p>Dr. Tiger chuckled. "You're 
not as sleepy as you sound. I'm sending you a fax right now. Do you see it?"</p><p><img SRC="../ta4graph/tigertrap2.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Tiger in a trap" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="172">"Good 
Lord," I said, looking at the fax. "Is this tiger in a leg trap?"</p><p>"That's 
right," said Dr. Tiger. "That tiger lives in Royal Bengal Tiger Reserve 
in India. Two days ago, a Forest Service field officer found this tiger in the 
trap. We need to tell the world what's going on there. And you're just the journalist 
to do it."</p><p>"Me? Why me?"</p><p>"You know your way around 
India. You speak Hindi. And you'll do anything to help save the tiger. Am I right?"</p><p>I 
frowned. He was right. But was I up to the job? I'd spent ten years as a journalist 
in India, photographing tigers in my spare time. When I left to pursue other assignments, 
I figured I'd be back soon. But I never returned to India--except in my dreams.</p><p>"Dr.

align="left" naturalsizeflag="3" alt="Doctor">At a hospital in
Beijing, I found a doctor who spoke English. In fact, he had earned
his medical degree at Harvard.</p>
<p>"Doctor," I said. "Do you prescribe tiger parts for any
illnesses?"</p>
<p>He smiled at me. "Of course not. You've fallen for old Chinese
superstitions. Tiger fat cures hemmorrhoids. Tiger eyes improve
your vision. Tiger whiskers cure toothaches. Tiger penis makes
tigers of men. Tiger bones cure rheumatism as well as muscle spasms
and pain." He rolled his eyes. "There's no medical proof for any of
that."</p>
<p>I frowned. "So nobody uses tiger parts as medicine?"</p>
<p>He grimaced. "If only that were true. No, I'm afraid that many
people in China as well as Taiwan, Japan, Korea and other Asian
countries still do believe that tiger parts can improve their
health."</p>
<p>"And only tiger parts will do the trick?" I asked.</p>
<p>"There are some alternative medicines made from plants. But you
must understand that the use of tiger parts in medicine is deeply
embedded in our culture. Stopping Chinese people from believing in
the power of tiger medicine would be like stopping Americans from
driving their cars and watching TV."</p>
<p>"So these tiger medicines are for sale in drugstores?"</p>

drugstore. You'll see."</p>
<p>"Thanks, doc," I said. <a href="d3.htm">"I think I
will."</a></p>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Doctor">At a hospital in Beijing, I found a doctor
who spoke English. In fact, he had earned his medical degree at Harvard.</P>

<P>&quot;Doctor,&quot; I said. &quot;Do you prescribe tiger parts for any
illnesses?&quot;</P>

<P>He smiled at me. &quot;Of course not. You've fallen for old Chinese superstitions.
Tiger fat cures hemmorrhoids. Tiger eyes improve your vision. Tiger whiskers
cure toothaches. Tiger penis makes tigers of men. Tiger bones cure rheumatism
as well as muscle spasms and pain.&quot; He rolled his eyes. &quot;There's
no medical proof for any of that.&quot;</P>

<P>I frowned. &quot;So nobody uses tiger parts as medicine?&quot;</P>

<P>He grimaced. &quot;If only that were true. No, I'm afraid that many people
in China as well as Taiwan, Japan, Korea and other Asian countries still
do believe that tiger parts can improve their health.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And only tiger parts will do the trick?&quot; I asked.</P>

<P>&quot;There are some alternative medicines made from plants. But you
must understand that the use of tiger parts in medicine is deeply embedded
in our culture. Stopping Chinese people from believing in the power of tiger
medicine would be like stopping Americans from driving their cars and watching
TV.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So these tiger medicines are for sale in drugstores?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Thanks, doc,&quot; I said. <A HREF="d3.htm">&quot;I think I will.&quot;</A></TD></TR>

<p>We approached a ramshackle neighborhood. Goats ran along the
road at dusk, snorting and wallowing in the dirty gulleys alongside
the street. Though my dreams had always been of tigers in India's
forests, I remembered this part of India as well.</p>

front of a small shack. Sanjoy stepped out of the jeep. "Ranjit?"
he called out.</p>
<p>Ranjit appeared in a doorway, along with several other men. "You
have the money?" he asked in Hindi.</p>
<p>Sanjoy lifted the briefcase. "Right here."</p>
<p>"Very good," he said with a smile. Then he looked at me coldly.
My heart quickened. "Who is he?" Ranjit demanded.</p>
<p>"An interested party," Sanjoy said. "He wants to ensure the
quality of the goods."</p>
<p><img src="../ta4graph/ranjit.jpg" width="115" height="140"

"Of course."</p>
<p>"Let's drive somewhere else to make our deal." Sanjoy said. "I
do not like standing here in the open."</p>
<p>Ranjit gestured to a young man with a frizzy beard who wore a
shawl big enough to hide a shotgun. "Gopal," he said. "Come with
me."</p>
<p>Gopal returned with a large sack from the house. Sanjoy took it
from him. Gopal protested for a moment, then let him put it in the
back of the jeep. We all climbed into the vehicle--a very tight
fit. With Sanjoy driving, we puttered several miles down the dark
road.</p>
<p>We drove in silence. I couldn't resist asking the two poachers a
question.</p>

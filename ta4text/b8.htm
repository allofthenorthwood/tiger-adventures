<P>We approached a ramshackle neighborhood. Goats ran along the road at
dusk, snorting and wallowing in the dirty gulleys alongside the street.
Though my dreams had always been of tigers in India's forests, I remembered
this part of India as well.</P>

Sanjoy stepped out of the jeep. "Ranjit?" he called out.</P>

<P>Ranjit appeared in a doorway, along with several other men. "You
have the money?" he asked in Hindi.</P>

<P>Sanjoy lifted the briefcase. "Right here."</P>

<P>"Very good," he said with a smile. Then he looked at me coldly.
My heart quickened. "Who is he?" Ranjit demanded.</P>

<P>"An interested party," Sanjoy said. "He wants to ensure
the quality of the goods."</P>

<P>"Let's drive somewhere else to make our deal." Sanjoy said.
"I do not like standing here in the open."</P>

<P>Ranjit gestured to a young man with a frizzy beard who wore a shawl big
enough to hide a shotgun. "Gopal," he said. "Come with me."</P>

<P>Gopal returned with a large sack from the house. Sanjoy took it from
him. Gopal protested for a moment, then let him put it in the back of the
jeep. We all climbed into the vehicle--a very tight fit. With Sanjoy driving,
we puttered several miles down the dark road.</P>

<P>We drove in silence. I couldn't resist asking the two poachers a question.</P>

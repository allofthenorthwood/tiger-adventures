<P>We approached a ramshackle neighborhood. Goats ran along the road at
dusk, snorting and wallowing in the dirty gulleys alongside the street.
Though my dreams had always been of tigers in India's forests, I remembered
this part of India as well.</P>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Ranjit's House">We parked in front of a small shack.
Sanjoy stepped out of the jeep. &quot;Ranjit?&quot; he called out.</P>

<P>Ranjit appeared in a doorway, along with several other men. &quot;You
have the money?&quot; he asked in Hindi.</P>

<P>Sanjoy lifted the briefcase. &quot;Right here.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Very good,&quot; he said with a smile. Then he looked at me coldly.
My heart quickened. &quot;Who is he?&quot; Ranjit demanded.</P>

<P>&quot;An interested party,&quot; Sanjoy said. &quot;He wants to ensure
the quality of the goods.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Let's drive somewhere else to make our deal.&quot; Sanjoy said.
&quot;I do not like standing here in the open.&quot;</P>

<P>Ranjit gestured to a young man with a frizzy beard who wore a shawl big
enough to hide a shotgun. &quot;Gopal,&quot; he said. &quot;Come with me.&quot;</P>

<P>Gopal returned with a large sack from the house. Sanjoy took it from
him. Gopal protested for a moment, then let him put it in the back of the
jeep. We all climbed into the vehicle--a very tight fit. With Sanjoy driving,
we puttered several miles down the dark road.</P>

<P>We drove in silence. I couldn't resist asking the two poachers a question.</P>

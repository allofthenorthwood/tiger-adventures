<P>Ranjit turned to Gopal and, speaking in Hindi, asked him: "How many
tigers have you taken this year?"</P>

<P>Gopal replied in Hindi. "I don't know. Five, ten, perhaps. Not enough.
My family barely has enough food to eat. If you would pay me more, then
it would be better."</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../ta4graph/deadtiger.jpg" WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="171" ALIGN=
"LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Poached tiger">Ranjit snapped, "Don't
get greedy!"</P>

<P>Anger flashed across Gopal's face. "What are you charging the foreigner
for these tiger skins? Five hundred dollars? Seven hundred? And yet you
pay me only 1,000 rupees--$30--for it. You are hardly better than the government,
which takes my land and gives it to the tiger, then forgets its promise
to help me find other ways to support my family."</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../ta4graph/bones3.jpg" WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="200" ALIGN="RIGHT"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Tiger bones and skin">Ranjit cut him off. "You
don't know your good luck," he told Gopal, still speaking in Hindi.
"We'll sell the tiger skins now, and still have the bones to sell another
day."</P>

<P>Then Ranjit turned to me and smiled. In English, he said, "Gopal
says he has killed only a few tigers. There are many more tigers in the
forest. The government says there are over 100 tigers in the Royal Bengal
Forest Reserve alone."</P>

<P>I could not hold my tongue. "But I've heard that there are only
a few dozen left. It wouldn't take many poachers to wipe out the tiger population
here."</P>

<P>Ranjit squinted suspiciously at me. "Who told you that?"</P>

<P>I shrugged, suddenly worried. I didn't want to admit that I knew any
tiger conservationists. And I could see that Sanjoy was worried now too.
Hastily, I explained...</P>

<p>Ranjit turned to Gopal and, speaking in Hindi, asked him: "How
many tigers have you taken this year?"</p>
<p>Gopal replied in Hindi. "I don't know. Five, ten, perhaps. Not
enough. My family barely has enough food to eat. If you would pay
me more, then it would be better."</p>
<p><img src="../ta4graph/deadtiger.jpg" width="260" height="171"

snapped, "Don't get greedy!"</p>
<p>Anger flashed across Gopal's face. "What are you charging the
foreigner for these tiger skins? Five hundred dollars? Seven
hundred? And yet you pay me only 1,000 rupees--$30--for it. You are
hardly better than the government, which takes my land and gives it
to the tiger, then forgets its promise to help me find other ways
to support my family."</p>

cut him off. "You don't know your good luck," he told Gopal, still
speaking in Hindi. "We'll sell the tiger skins now, and still have
the bones to sell another day."</p>
<p>Then Ranjit turned to me and smiled. In English, he said, "Gopal
says he has killed only a few tigers. There are many more tigers in
the forest. The government says there are over 100 tigers in the
Royal Bengal Forest Reserve alone."</p>
<p>I could not hold my tongue. "But I've heard that there are only
a few dozen left. It wouldn't take many poachers to wipe out the
tiger population here."</p>
<p>Ranjit squinted suspiciously at me. "Who told you that?"</p>
<p>I shrugged, suddenly worried. I didn't want to admit that I knew
any tiger conservationists. And I could see that Sanjoy was worried
now too. Hastily, I explained...</p>

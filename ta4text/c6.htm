<h2><font size="+0">C6 Going to Lhasa</font></h2>
<p><font size="-1">I caught the next airplane to Lhasa. The flight
over the Himalaya Mountains was pretty rough. I was glad I had
skipped breakfast.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The views were incredible, but they made me
dizzy. To distract myself, I opened Dr. Tiger's handbook and read
about Tibet:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">Tibet is often called the "Roof of the World,"
since it is located on the world's highest plateau. Most of Tibet
lies more than 12,000 feet above sea level. Tibet was once the most
geographically isolated country in the world. In 1959 Tibet lost
its independence when China took control and renamed it Xizang
(sit-sang). Many Tibetans still resist Chinese control, but
resistance becomes more difficult as China strengthens its economic
links with Tibet.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">When we landed in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, I
took a cab into town. I asked the cab driver, <a href=

Kelsang?"</a></font> <font size="-1">&copy;</font></p>

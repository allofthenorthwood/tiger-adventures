<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I caught the next airplane to Lhasa. The flight over the
Himalaya Mountains was pretty rough. I was glad I had skipped breakfast.

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The views were incredible, but they made me dizzy. To distract
myself, I opened Dr. Tiger's handbook and read about Tibet:</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Tibet is often called the "Roof of the World,"
  since it is located on the world's highest plateau. Most of Tibet lies
  more than 12,000 feet above sea level. Tibet was once the most geographically
  isolated country in the world. In 1959 Tibet lost its independence when
  China took control and renamed it Xizang (sit-sang). Many Tibetans still
  resist Chinese control, but resistance becomes more difficult as China
  strengthens its economic links with Tibet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>When we landed in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, I took a
cab into town. I asked the cab driver, <A HREF="c7.htm">"Where can
I find someone named Lobsang Kelsang?"</A></FONT>

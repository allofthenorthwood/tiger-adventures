<P>"Dangerous work?" said Ranjit. "Perhaps for a wealthy
person like you. But tigers are not the romantic creatures that you foreigners
think they are. They attack and kill our cattle, our goats, even our children
sometimes. Gopal must protect his family from these predators. And he must
earn money to support his family."</P>

I said. "Is this his only source of income?"</P>

<P>Ranjit turned to Gopal and asked him the same question in Hindi. Gopal
said, "Not with what you pay me. How many tigers do I bring you in
a year? Five, ten? And still my family does not have enough food to eat.
What are you charging the foreigner for these tiger skins? Five hundred
dollars? Seven hundred? And yet you pay me only 1,000 rupees--not even $30--for
it. You take what is mine. You're no better than the government bureaucrats.
They took our land and gave it to the tigers. They promised to help us find
other ways to support ourselves and our families. But they have done nothing."</P>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Tiger bones and skin">Ranjit cut him off. "You
don't know your good luck," he told Gopal, still speaking in Hindi.
"We'll sell the tiger skins now, and still have the bones to sell another
day."</P>

<P>Then Ranjit turned to me and smiled. In English, he said, "Gopal
grows a few crops, but he's much happier helping me bring tiger skins to
you. If you wish, we can bring you more tomorrow. There are many more tigers
in the forest. The government says there are over 100 tigers in the Royal
Bengal Forest Reserve alone."</P>

<P>I could not hold my tongue. "Some conservationists say there are
only a few dozen left. It wouldn't take many poachers to wipe out the tiger
population here."</P>

<P>Ranjit squinted suspiciously at me. "Why do you care what conservationists
say?"</P>

<P>I shrugged, suddenly worried. I could see that Sanjoy was worried now
too. Hastily, I explained...</P>

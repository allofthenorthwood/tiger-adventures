<p>"Dangerous work?" said Ranjit. "Perhaps for a wealthy person
like you. But tigers are not the romantic creatures that you
foreigners think they are. They attack and kill our cattle, our
goats, even our children sometimes. Gopal must protect his family
from these predators. And he must earn money to support his
family."</p>
<p><img src="../ta4graph/deadtiger.jpg" width="260" height="171"
align="left" naturalsizeflag="3" alt="Poached tiger">"I suppose
so," I said. "Is this his only source of income?"</p>
<p>Ranjit turned to Gopal and asked him the same question in Hindi.
Gopal said, "Not with what you pay me. How many tigers do I bring
you in a year? Five, ten? And still my family does not have enough
food to eat. What are you charging the foreigner for these tiger
skins? Five hundred dollars? Seven hundred? And yet you pay me only
1,000 rupees--not even $30--for it. You take what is mine. You're
no better than the government bureaucrats. They took our land and
gave it to the tigers. They promised to help us find other ways to
support ourselves and our families. But they have done
nothing."</p>
<p><img src="../ta4graph/bones3.jpg" width="174" height="200"
align="right" naturalsizeflag="3" alt="Tiger bones and skin">Ranjit
cut him off. "You don't know your good luck," he told Gopal, still
speaking in Hindi. "We'll sell the tiger skins now, and still have
the bones to sell another day."</p>
<p>Then Ranjit turned to me and smiled. In English, he said, "Gopal
grows a few crops, but he's much happier helping me bring tiger
skins to you. If you wish, we can bring you more tomorrow. There
are many more tigers in the forest. The government says there are
over 100 tigers in the Royal Bengal Forest Reserve alone."</p>
<p>I could not hold my tongue. "Some conservationists say there are
only a few dozen left. It wouldn't take many poachers to wipe out
the tiger population here."</p>
<p>Ranjit squinted suspiciously at me. "Why do you care what
conservationists say?"</p>
<p>I shrugged, suddenly worried. I could see that Sanjoy was
worried now too. Hastily, I explained...</p>

Hopes to Breed Tigers</b></p><p><img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">Donald 
T. Wilson, owner of Don Wilson's Wildlife Wonderland, expressed hope yesterday 
that his captive tiger and the tiger at the zoo would be bred. &quot;It's a win-win 
situation,&quot; he said. &quot;They've got a male tiger, I've got a female tiger. 
Why not let nature take her course?&quot; <br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">Wilson, 
who fought zoo officials for custody of the tiger, says he feels no ill will against 
the zoo. &quot;Of course they wanted the tiger--they've got to attract tourists 
to the zoo. I just wish they were more devoted to educating our young people about 
wildlife. But by breeding our tigers, I think we can make a positive step forward 
together. I sincerely hope it comes to pass.&quot;</td></tr> <tr> <td WIDTH="33%" HEIGHT="540" VALIGN="TOP"><img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">The 
San Gabriel Zoo unveiled its new exhibit yesterday to house the Sumatran tiger 
which briefly roamed the area earlier this year.<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">According 
to Zoo officials, the tiger enclosure incorporates the best and most current thinking 
in zoo exhibit design. &quot;We've provided the tiger with a natural environment 
and many things to enrich its life, such as scratching logs and heat pads, and 
of course a healthy diet. I hope everyone comes out to the zoo to get to know 
our newest resident.&quot;<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">However, 
some visitors to the zoo yesterday said the tiger did not appear as happy as they 
would have liked. &quot;He looked so hot,&quot; said Danny Bence, age 10. &quot;He 
was laying there on the rock with his tongue hanging out like he was gonna die.&quot; 
Other visitors also commented on the tiger's appearance. Art Ocampo, 42, said, 
&quot;He looked like he was about to faint from sunstroke, or something.&quot;<br> 
<img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">Zoo 
officials denied that the tiger not in the best of health, but Victor Sanchez, 
an employee of El Paso Zoo who came to San Gabriel for the occasion, was concerned 
about the lack of water and shade. &quot;Tigers love <br> <br> </td><td WIDTH="33%" VALIGN="TOP"><p><img SRC="../ta2graph/tigexhbt.jpg" WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="94" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="1" ALT="Tiger in exhibit"><br>

he said, &quot;but there aren't any pools or creeks in this exhibit for the tiger 
to bathe in. No wonder he's hot.&quot;<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">An 
employee of the San Gabriel Zoo who asked to remain anonymous also voiced concern 
about the tiger's condition. &quot;They feed him whenever he wants to eat. For 
a tiger, that's all the time. He's looking chubby already, and it's only going 
to get worse.&quot; Dr. Armitage Douglas, a veterinarian for the American Association 
of Zoos and Aquariums, said there was a some basis for this concern. &quot;In 
the wild, the scarcity of game regulates a tiger's eating schedule. In a zoo, 
the keeper has to regulate that schedule. A tiger's instincts tell him to eat 
whenever he can--so of course a tiger which is fed on demand will gain weight.&quot;<br> 
<img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">Dr. 
Douglas added another cause for concern about the tiger's care. &quot;If you let 
him eat in the exhibit, you can't monitor his diet. The first thing a tiger does 
when it's sick is stop eating, but you wouldn't notice if you didn't bring it 
in every night to feed it. This tiger could become very sick before anyone even 
noticed.&quot;</td></tr> </table></h2><p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font COLOR="#663300" SIZE="+1">What

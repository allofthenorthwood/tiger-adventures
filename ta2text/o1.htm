                  expressed hope yesterday that his captive tiger and the tiger
                  at the zoo would be bred. "It's a win-win situation," he said.
                  "They've got a male tiger, I've got a female tiger. Why not
                  let nature take her course?"<br />

                  />Wilson, who fought zoo officials for custody of the tiger,
                  says he feels no ill will against the zoo. "Of course they
                  wanted the tiger--they've got to attract tourists to the zoo.
                  I just wish they were more devoted to educating our young
                  people about wildlife. But by breeding our tigers, I think we
                  can make a positive step forward together. I sincerely hope it
                  comes to pass."

                house the Sumatran tiger which briefly roamed the area earlier
                this year.<br />

                />According to Zoo officials, the tiger enclosure incorporates
                the best and most current thinking in zoo exhibit design. "We've
                provided the tiger with a natural environment and many things to
                enrich its life, such as scratching logs, water, and heat pads,
                and of course a healthy diet. I hope everyone comes out to the
                zoo to get to know our newest resident."<br />

                />However, some visitors to the zoo yesterday said the tiger did
                not appear as happy as they would have liked. "I saw him throw
                up!" said Danny Bence, age 10. "Right in front of us!" Zoo
                officials denied that the tiger was not in the best of health,
                but Victor Sanchez, a botanist at El Paso Zoo who came to San
                Gabriel for the occasion, was concerned about the vegetation.
                "From what I could see, they planted poison sumac right in the
                tiger's enclosure. That's toxic to tigers. It won't kill him,

                  />An employee of the San Gabriel Zoo who asked to remain
                  anonymous also voiced concern about the tiger's condition.
                  "They feed him whenever he wants to eat. For a tiger, that's
                  all the time. He's looking chubby already, and it's only going
                  to get worse." Dr. Armitage Douglas, a veterinarian for the
                  American Association of Zoos and Aquariums, said there was a
                  some basis for this concern. "In the wild, the scarcity of
                  game regulates a tiger's eating schedule. In a zoo, the keeper
                  has to regulate that schedule. A tiger's instincts tell him to
                  eat whenever he can--so of course a tiger which is fed on
                  demand will gain weight."<br />
                  <img
                    src="../../images/dot.gif"
                    width="8"
                    height="4"
                    align="left"
                    naturalsizeflag="0"
                    alt="spacer gif"
                  />Dr. Douglas added another cause for concern about the
                  tiger's care. "If you let him eat in the exhibit, you can't
                  monitor his diet. The first thing a tiger does when it's sick
                  is stop eating, but you wouldn't notice if you didn't bring it
                  in every night to feed it. This tiger could become very sick
                  before anyone even noticed."

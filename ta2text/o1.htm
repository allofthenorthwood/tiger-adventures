Hopes to Breed Tigers</b></p><p><img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
        ALT="spacer gif">Donald T. Wilson, owner of Don Wilson's Wildlife Wonderland, 
expressed hope yesterday that his captive tiger and the tiger at the zoo would 
be bred. &quot;It's a win-win situation,&quot; he said. &quot;They've got a male 
tiger, I've got a female tiger. Why not let nature take her course?&quot; <br> 
<img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
        ALT="spacer gif">Wilson, who fought zoo officials for custody of the tiger, 
says he feels no ill will against the zoo. &quot;Of course they wanted the tiger--they've 
got to attract tourists to the zoo. I just wish they were more devoted to educating 
our young people about wildlife. But by breeding our tigers, I think we can make 
a positive step forward together. I sincerely hope it comes to pass.&quot;</td></tr>

        ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">The San Gabriel Zoo 
unveiled its new exhibit yesterday to house the Sumatran tiger which briefly roamed 
the area earlier this year.<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
        ALT="spacer gif">According to Zoo officials, the tiger enclosure incorporates 
the best and most current thinking in zoo exhibit design. &quot;We've provided 
the tiger with a natural environment and many things to enrich its life, such 
as scratching logs, water, and heat pads, and of course a healthy diet. I hope 
everyone comes out to the zoo to get to know our newest resident.&quot;<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
        ALT="spacer gif">However, some visitors to the zoo yesterday said the 
tiger did not appear as happy as they would have liked. &quot;I saw him throw 
up!&quot; said Danny Bence, age 10. &quot;Right in front of us!&quot; Zoo officials 
denied that the tiger was not in the best of health, but Victor Sanchez, a botanist 
at El Paso Zoo who came to San Gabriel for the occasion, was concerned about the 
vegetation. &quot;From what I could see, they planted poison sumac right in the 
tiger's enclosure. That's toxic to tigers. It won't kill him, <p>&nbsp;</p><p><br> <br>

        ALT="spacer gif">An employee of the San Gabriel Zoo who asked to remain 
anonymous also voiced concern about the tiger's condition. &quot;They feed him 
whenever he wants to eat. For a tiger, that's all the time. He's looking chubby 
already, and it's only going to get worse.&quot; Dr. Armitage Douglas, a veterinarian 
for the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums, said there was a some basis 
for this concern. &quot;In the wild, the scarcity of game regulates a tiger's 
eating schedule. In a zoo, the keeper has to regulate that schedule. A tiger's 
instincts tell him to eat whenever he can--so of course a tiger which is fed on 
demand will gain weight.&quot;<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
        ALT="spacer gif">Dr. Douglas added another cause for concern about the 
tiger's care. &quot;If you let him eat in the exhibit, you can't monitor his diet. 
The first thing a tiger does when it's sick is stop eating, but you wouldn't notice 
if you didn't bring it in every night to feed it. This tiger could become very 
sick before anyone even noticed.&quot;</td></tr> </table><p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font COLOR="#663300" SIZE="+1">What

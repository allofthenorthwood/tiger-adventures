                    Wonderland, said that Zoo officials were incompetent and
                    should not have been given custody of the Sumatran tiger
                    which escaped yesterday from the zoo.<img

                    Wilson, who has been vying for custody of the tiger for
                    months, said that the tiger's escape proves that he has been
                    right from the start. "I've been saying for months that
                    I can provide a better home for the tiger. The only
                    difference is that now everybody knows I'm right. What a
                    waste of taxpayer money. I just hope that people come to
                    their senses and give me the tiger before any more money is
                    spent on the Zoo's incompetent attempt at a tiger
                    enclosure."<br />

                    only minor alterations. "Don Wilson can talk all he
                    wants," said a Zoo employee who asked to remain
                    anonymous. "But he's running a circus out there, not a
                    real zoo. I just hope the people of San Gabriel see the
                    difference and continue to support us."

                  which had been designed and built expressly for it, and roamed
                  the zoo grounds for fifteen hours before it was captured and
                  returned to its holding room. No one was injured in the
                  incident, though Zoo officials are still checking to be sure

                    exhibit, claiming it to be safe and secure as well as
                    attractive and educational. Zoo officials now say they will
                    delay the tiger exhibit's grand opening, scheduled for next
                    week, while they re-evaluate the design. "Mistakes were
                    made," said the zookeeper. "It's our job to
                    rectify them."

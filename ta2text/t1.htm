                  said that Zoo officials were incompetent and should not have
                  been given custody of the Sumatran tiger which escaped
                  yesterday from the zoo.<img

                  Wilson, who has been vying for custody of the tiger for
                  months, said that the tiger's escape proves that he has been
                  right from the start. "I've been saying for months that I can
                  provide a better home for the tiger. The only difference is
                  that now everybody knows I'm right. What a waste of taxpayer
                  money. I just hope that people come to their senses and give
                  me the tiger before any more money is spent on the Zoo's
                  incompetent attempt at a tiger enclosure."<br />

                  only minor alterations. "Don Wilson can talk all he wants,"
                  said a Zoo employee who asked to remain anonymous. "But he's
                  running a circus out there, not a real zoo. I just hope the
                  people of San Gabriel see the difference and continue to
                  support us."

                grounds for fifteen hours before it was captured and returned to
                its holding room. No one was injured in the incident, though Zoo
                officials are still checking to be sure that no other zoo animal

                  attractive and educational. Zoo officials now say they will

                  week, while they re-evaluate the design. "Mistakes were made,"
                  said the zookeeper. "It's our job to rectify them."

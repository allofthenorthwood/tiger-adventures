Wilson, who has been vying for custody of the tiger for months, said that the 
tiger's escape proves that he has been right from the start. &quot;I've been saying 
for months that I can provide a better home for the tiger. The only difference 
is that now everybody knows I'm right. What a waste of taxpayer money. I just 
hope that people come to their senses and give me the tiger before any more money 
is spent on the Zoo's incompetent attempt at a tiger enclosure.&quot;<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">Zoo 
officials maintained that their exhibit design needed only minor alterations. 
&quot;Don Wilson can talk all he wants,&quot; said a Zoo employee who asked to 
remain anonymous. &quot;But he's running a circus out there, not a real zoo. I 
just hope the people of San Gabriel see the difference and continue to support 
us.&quot;</td></tr> <tr> <td WIDTH="33%" HEIGHT="526" VALIGN="TOP"><img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">A 
Sumatran tiger escaped yesterday from the new exhibit which had been designed 
and built expressly for it, and roamed the zoo grounds for fifteen hours before 
it was captured and returned to its holding room. No one was injured in the incident, 
though Zoo officials are still checking to be sure that no other zoo animal fell 
prey to the wandering tiger.<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">The

days ago, the Zoo was boasting about its new tiger exhibit, claiming it to be 
safe and secure as well as attractive and educational. Zoo officials now say they 
will delay the tiger exhibit's grand opening, scheduled for next week, while they 
re-evaluate the design. &quot;Mistakes were made,&quot; said the zookeeper. &quot;It's 
our job to rectify them.&quot;</td></tr> </table></h2><p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font COLOR="#663300" SIZE="+1">What

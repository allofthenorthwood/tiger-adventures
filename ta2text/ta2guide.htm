    <p>
      <b>What is it?</b> "Zoo Tiger" is an online interactive
      adventure designed to teach about zoo philosophy, exhibit design, tiger
      biology, and behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Scene:</b> You are a zookeeper in a fictional southwestern city.
      You are asked to design a zoo exhibit to house your new tiger (acquired in
      "Tiger on the Loose"). You must balance the needs of your
      captive tiger with the demands of public viewing to construct a suitable
      enclosure. You will also consider the purpose of zoos in our society.
      Based on your knowledge of tiger biology and behavior, you must hire an
      architect, landscape architect, and veterinarian to complete your exhibit
      and ensure the health of your tiger. A wrong decision can have serious
      consequences that don't appear until the end of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Who Can Play? </b>Students can play independently or in small groups.
      You could also project it on a screen for a whole class activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Zoo Tiger" is written for fifth grade and older. There is a
      significant amount of text in the form of fictional newspaper articles,
      letters and memos. Players are also asked to examine simple exhibit plans,
      and interpret graphics and animations to make their choices.
    </p>
    <p>
      All our Tiger Adventures are designed to download quickly using Netscape 2
      and Exlplorer 3 and above.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>How To Play: </b>Encourage students to read and look carefully before
      making choices. The Tiger Handbook will provide the necessary information
      construct a successful and healthy exhibit for your tiger. The Tiger
      Handbook also challenges players to consider the role of zoos in our
      society as well as how to balance the needs of the animals with the
      desires of the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may want to assign the
      <a href="ta2work.htm">Zoo Tiger Worksheet</a> to focus and track your
      students' progress. Use the <a href="ta2key.htm">teacher key</a> for
      guidance in correcting or leading a discussion.

      Tiger Care (diet, healthcare...)<br />
      Purpose of Zoos<br />

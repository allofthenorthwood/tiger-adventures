Tiger&quot; Teachers' Guide</h2><p><b>What is it?</b> &quot;Zoo Tiger&quot; is 
an online interactive adventure designed to teach about zoo philosophy, exhibit 
design, tiger biology, and behavior.</p><p><b>The Scene:</b> You are a zookeeper 
in a fictional southwestern city. You are asked to design a zoo exhibit to house 
your new tiger (acquired in &quot;Tiger on the Loose&quot;). You must balance 
the needs of your captive tiger with the demands of public viewing to construct 
a suitable enclosure. You will also consider the purpose of zoos in our society. 
Based on your knowledge of tiger biology and behavior, you must hire an architect, 
landscape architect, and veterinarian to complete your exhibit and ensure the 
health of your tiger. A wrong decision can have serious consequences that don't 
appear until the end of the game.</p><p><b>Who Can Play? </b>Students can play 
independently or in small groups. You could also project it on a screen for a 
whole class activity.</p><p>&quot;Zoo Tiger&quot; is written for fifth grade and 
older. There is a significant amount of text in the form of fictional newspaper 
articles, letters and memos. Players are also asked to examine simple exhibit 
plans, and interpret graphics and animations to make their choices.</p><p>All 
our Tiger Adventures are designed to download quickly using Netscape 2 and Exlplorer 
3 and above.</p><p><b>How To Play: </b>Encourage students to read and look carefully 
before making choices. The Tiger Handbook will provide the necessary information 
construct a successful and healthy exhibit for your tiger. The Tiger Handbook 
also challenges players to consider the role of zoos in our society as well as 
how to balance the needs of the animals with the desires of the public.</p><p>You 
may want to assign the <a HREF="ta2work.htm">Zoo Tiger Worksheet</a> to focus 
and track your students' progress. Use the <a HREF="ta2key.htm">teacher key</a> 
for guidance in correcting or leading a discussion.</p><p><b>Concepts Taught: 
</b></p><p>Tiger Behavior<br> Tiger Care (diet, healthcare...)<br> Purpose of 
Zoos<br> Exhibit Design (materials, aesthetics, space, environment)</p><p>These 
topics are also explained in topical form, using graphics, animations, and thought-provoking 
queries, in the <a HREF="../handbook/handbk2.htm">Tiger Handbook</a>.</p><p>If 
your students enjoyed &quot;ZooTiger&quot;, have them play the prequel <a
HREF="../adventxt/a1.htm">&quot;Tiger on the Loose&quot;</a> (<a
HREF="../adventxt/ta1guide.htm">Teachers' Guide</a>) and the sequel &quot;<a

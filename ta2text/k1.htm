T. Wilson, owner of Don Wilson's Wildlife Wonderland, expressed hope yesterday 
that his captive tiger and the tiger at the zoo would be bred. &quot;It's a win-win 
situation,&quot; he said. &quot;They've got a male tiger, I've got a female tiger. 
Why not let nature take her course?&quot; <br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">Wilson, 
who fought zoo officials for custody of the tiger, says he feels no ill will against 
the zoo. &quot;Of course they wanted the tiger--they've got to attract tourists 
to the zoo. I just wish they were more devoted to educating our young people about 
wildlife. But by breeding our tigers, I think we can make a positive step forward 
together. I sincerely hope it comes to pass.&quot;</td></tr> <tr> <td WIDTH="33%" HEIGHT="540" VALIGN="TOP"><img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">The 
San Gabriel Zoo unveiled its new exhibit yesterday to house the Sumatran tiger 
which briefly roamed the area earlier this year.<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">According 
to the zookeeper, the tiger enclosure incorporates the best and most current thinking 
in zoo exhibit design. &quot;We've provided the tiger with a natural environment 
and many things to enrich its life, such as scratching logs and heat pads, and 
of course a healthy diet. I hope everyone comes out to the zoo to get to know 
our newest resident.&quot;<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">However, 
some visitors to the zoo yesterday said the tiger did not appear as happy as they 
would have liked. &quot;He looked so hot,&quot; said Danny Bence, age 10. &quot;He 
was laying there on the rock with his tongue hanging out like he was gonna die.&quot; 
Other visitors also commented on the tiger's appearance. Art Ocampo, 42, said, 
&quot;He looked like he was about to faint from sunstroke, or something.&quot;<br>

health, but Victor Sanchez, an employee of El Paso Zoo who came to San Gabriel 
for the occasion, was concerned about the lack of water and shade. &quot;Tigers 
love water,&quot; he said, &quot;but there aren't any pools or creeks in this 
exhibit for the tiger to bathe in. No wonder he's hot.&quot;<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">An 
employee of the San Gabriel Zoo, who asked to remain anonymous, also voiced concern 
about the tiger's condition. &quot;All they ever feed him is cat food. If he doesn't 
get his teeth into some real bone, he'll develop tooth trouble soon.&quot; Dr. 
Armitage Douglas, a veterinarian for the American Association of Zoos and Aquarium, 
said there was a some basis for this concern. &quot;A tiger which eats only commercially-prepared 
food might, in time, develop gum disease and cavities. You can't floss a tiger's 
teeth, but you can give it enough of a variety of foods to prevent these problems.</td></tr>

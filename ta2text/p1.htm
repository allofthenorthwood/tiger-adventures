T. Wilson, owner of Don Wilson's Wildlife Wonderland, expressed hope yesterday 
that his captive tiger and the tiger at the zoo would be bred. &quot;It's a win-win 
situation,&quot; he said. &quot;They've got a male tiger, I've got a female tiger. 
Why not let nature take her course?&quot; <br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">Wilson, 
who fought zoo officials for custody of the tiger, says he feels no ill will against 
the zoo. &quot;Of course they wanted the tiger--they've got to attract tourists 
to the zoo. I just wish they were more devoted to educating our young people about 
wildlife. But by breeding our tigers, I think we can make a positive step forward 
together. I sincerely hope it comes to pass.&quot;</td></tr> <tr> <td WIDTH="33%" HEIGHT="414" VALIGN="TOP"><img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">The

and of course a healthy diet. I hope everyone comes out to the zoo to get to know 
our newest resident.&quot;<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">However,

for the occasion, was concerned about the vegetation. &quot;From what I could 
see, they planted poison sumac right in the tiger's enclosure. That's toxic to 
tigers. It won't kill him, but it'll make him pretty sick.&quot;<br> </td></tr>

                    Wonderland, expressed hope yesterday that his captive tiger
                    and the tiger at the zoo would be bred. "It's a win-win
                    situation," he said. "They've got a male tiger, I've got a
                    female tiger. Why not let nature take her course?" <br />

                    />Wilson, who fought zoo officials for custody of the tiger,
                    says he feels no ill will against the zoo. "Of course they
                    wanted the tiger--they've got to attract tourists to the
                    zoo. I just wish they were more devoted to educating our
                    young people about wildlife. But by breeding our tigers, I
                    think we can make a positive step forward together. I
                    sincerely hope it comes to pass."

                  the best and most current thinking in zoo exhibit design.
                  "We've provided the tiger with a natural environment and many
                  things to enrich its life, such as scratching logs, water, and
                  heat pads, and of course a healthy diet. I hope everyone comes

                    Bence, age 10. "Right in front of us!" Zoo officials denied
                    that the tiger was not in the best of health, but Victor
                    Sanchez, a botanist at El Paso Zoo who came to San Gabriel
                    for the occasion, was concerned about the vegetation. "From
                    what I could see, they planted poison sumac right in the
                    tiger's enclosure. That's toxic to tigers. It won't kill
                    him, but it'll make him pretty sick."<br />

                  expressed hope yesterday that his captive tiger and the tiger
                  at the zoo would be bred. "It's a win-win situation," he said.
                  "They've got a male tiger, I've got a female tiger. Why not
                  let nature take her course?"<br />

                  />Wilson, who fought zoo officials for custody of the tiger,
                  says he feels no ill will against the zoo. "Of course they
                  wanted the tiger--they've got to attract tourists to the zoo.
                  I just wish they were more devoted to educating our young
                  people about wildlife. But by breeding our tigers, I think we
                  can make a positive step forward together. I sincerely hope it
                  comes to pass."

                the best and most current thinking in zoo exhibit design. "We've
                provided the tiger with a natural environment and many things to
                enrich its life, such as scratching logs, water, and heat pads,
                and of course a healthy diet. I hope everyone comes out to the

                  ever feed him is cat food. If he doesn't get his teeth into
                  some real bone, he'll develop tooth trouble soon." A
                  veterinarian for the American Association of Zoos and
                  Aquariums said there was a some basis for this concern. "A
                  tiger which eats only commercially-prepared food might, in
                  time, develop gum disease and cavities. You can't floss a
                  tiger's teeth, but you can give it enough of a variety of
                  foods to prevent these problems."<br />

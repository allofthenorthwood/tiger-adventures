                    Wonderland, expressed hope yesterday that his captive tiger
                    and the tiger at the zoo would be bred. "It's a win-win
                    situation," he said. "They've got a male tiger,
                    I've got a female tiger. Why not let nature take her
                    course?" <br />

                    />Wilson, who fought zoo officials for custody of the tiger,
                    says he feels no ill will against the zoo. "Of course
                    they wanted the tiger--they've got to attract tourists to
                    the zoo. I just wish they were more devoted to educating our
                    young people about wildlife. But by breeding our tigers, I
                    think we can make a positive step forward together. I
                    sincerely hope it comes to pass."

                  this year.<br />

                  the best and most current thinking in zoo exhibit design.
                  "We've provided the tiger with a natural environment and
                  many things to enrich its life, such as scratching logs and
                  heat pads, and of course a healthy diet. I hope everyone comes
                  out to the zoo to get to know our newest resident."<br />

                  did not appear as happy as they would have liked. "He
                  looked so hot," said Danny Bence, age 10. <br />

                    hanging out like he was gonna die." Other visitors also
                    commented on the tiger's appearance. Art Ocampo, 42, said,
                    "He looked like he was about to faint from sunstroke,
                    or something."<br />

                    health, but Victor Sanchez, an employee of El Paso Zoo who
                    came to San Gabriel for the occasion, was concerned about
                    the lack of water and shade. "Tigers love water,"
                    he said, "but there aren't any pools or creeks in this
                    exhibit for the tiger to bathe in. No wonder he's
                    hot."<br />

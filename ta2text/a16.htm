the Tiger!</b></p><p>The San Gabriel Gazette is sponsoring a contest to name the 
tiger which was recently captured after escaping from airport customs. The winner 
will receive an autographed poster of a Sumatran tiger by renowned wildlife photographer 
Tom Brakefield.<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
        ALT="spacer gif">The winning entry will be selected by a panel of judges 
and Zoo staff chosen by the Gazette. Submit your entry by e-mail by April 25, 
1997 <em>(<strong>note:</strong> sorry, the contest is over)</em>. Be sure to 
include the following information: your name and email address, your suggestion 
for the tiger's name, and your reason for giving the tiger this name. Remember 
that the tiger came from Sumatra, an island in Indonesia. Names drawing on Indonesian 
or Sumatran culture, language or natural history have a better chance of winning 
the contest.</td></tr> <tr> <td WIDTH="33%" HEIGHT="411" VALIGN="TOP"><img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1"

Council meeting, a storm of protest greeted the plans for the new exhibit to house 
the tiger which recently ran loose in the San Gabriel area. <br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
        ALT="spacer gif">The plan calls for a small, concrete-floored exhibit 
measuring sixty feet by thirty feet. According to Zoo officials the plan was chosen 
because it will give zoo visitors a close-up view of the tiger. It will also be 
low-cost, easy to maintain and clean. <br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
        ALT="spacer gif">Critics, however, denounced the exhibit. Mark Fahey, 
president of the San Gabriel Animal Humane Society, said, &quot;You might as well 
put the tiger in jail. It's a tiny, cramped, inhumane cell, and I don't think 
the people of San Gabriel will stand for it.&quot; <br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"

that the City Council will review the decision, and perhaps take a closer look 
at other management actions by the zoo.<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
        ALT="spacer gif">Donald T. Wilson, owner of Don Wilson's Wildlife Wonderland, 
also criticized the plan. &quot;I've said again and again that the zoo is not 
the place for this tiger. My Wildlife Wonderland already has a well-designed tiger 
area. It's just common sense that the tiger come here.&quot;</td></tr> </table><p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font COLOR="#663300" SIZE="+1">What

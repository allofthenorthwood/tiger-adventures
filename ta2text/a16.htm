                  The San Gabriel Gazette is sponsoring a contest to name the
                  tiger which was recently captured after escaping from airport
                  customs. The winner will receive an autographed poster of a
                  Sumatran tiger by renowned wildlife photographer Tom
                  Brakefield.<br />

                    alt="spacer gif"
                  />The winning entry will be selected by a panel of judges and
                  Zoo staff chosen by the Gazette. Submit your entry by e-mail
                  by April 25, 1997
                  <em>(<strong>note:</strong> sorry, the contest is over)</em>.
                  Be sure to include the following information: your name and
                  email address, your suggestion for the tiger's name, and your
                  reason for giving the tiger this name. Remember that the tiger
                  came from Sumatra, an island in Indonesia. Names drawing on
                  Indonesian or Sumatran culture, language or natural history
                  have a better chance of winning the contest.

                />At last night's City Council meeting, a storm of protest
                greeted the plans for the new exhibit to house the tiger which
                recently ran loose in the San Gabriel area.<br />
                <img
                  src="../../images/dot.gif"
                  width="5"

                  alt="spacer gif"
                />The plan calls for a small, concrete-floored exhibit measuring
                sixty feet by thirty feet. According to Zoo officials the plan
                was chosen because it will give zoo visitors a close-up view of
                the tiger. It will also be low-cost, easy to maintain and
                clean.<br />
                <img
                  src="../../images/dot.gif"
                  width="5"

                  alt="spacer gif"
                />Critics, however, denounced the exhibit. Mark Fahey, president
                of the San Gabriel Animal Humane Society, said, "You might as
                well put the tiger in jail. It's a tiny, cramped, inhumane cell,
                and I don't think the people of San Gabriel will stand for
                it."<br />

                  In an unprecedented move, Mayor Janet Roebuck announced that
                  the City Council will review the decision, and perhaps take a
                  closer look at other management actions by the zoo.<br />

                  />Donald T. Wilson, owner of Don Wilson's Wildlife Wonderland,
                  also criticized the plan. "I've said again and again that the
                  zoo is not the place for this tiger. My Wildlife Wonderland
                  already has a well-designed tiger area. It's just common sense
                  that the tiger come here."

                    Wonderland, expressed hope yesterday that his captive tiger
                    and the tiger at the zoo would be bred. "It's a win-win
                    situation," he said. "They've got a male tiger,
                    I've got a female tiger. Why not let nature take her
                    course?" <br />

                    />Wilson, who fought zoo officials for custody of the tiger,
                    says he feels no ill will against the zoo. "Of course
                    they wanted the tiger--they've got to attract tourists to
                    the zoo. I just wish they were more devoted to educating our
                    young people about wildlife. But by breeding our tigers, I
                    think we can make a positive step forward together. I
                    sincerely hope it comes to pass."

                  this year.<br />

                  the best and most current thinking in zoo exhibit design.
                  "We've provided the tiger with a natural environment and
                  many things to enrich its life, such as scratching logs,
                  water, and heat pads, and of course a healthy diet. I hope
                  everyone comes out to the zoo to get to know our newest
                  resident."<br />

                  remain anonymous voiced concern about the tiger's condition.
                  "They feed him whenever he wants to eat. For a tiger,
                  that's all the time. He's looking chubby already, and it's
                  only going to get worse." Dr. Armitage Douglas, a
                  veterinarian

                    for the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums, said
                    there was a some basis for this concern. "In the wild,
                    the scarcity of game regulates a tiger's eating schedule. In
                    a zoo, the keeper has to regulate that schedule. A tiger's
                    instincts tell him to eat whenever he can--so of course a
                    tiger which is fed on demand will gain weight."<br />
                    <img
                      src="../../images/dot.gif"

                      alt="spacer gif"
                    />Dr. Douglas added another cause for concern about the
                    tiger's care. "If you let him eat in the exhibit, you
                    can't monitor his diet. The first thing a tiger does when
                    it's sick is stop eating, but you wouldn't notice if you
                    didn't bring it in every night to feed it. This tiger could
                    become very sick before anyone even noticed."<br />

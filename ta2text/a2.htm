                from airport customs may not end up at the San Gabriel Zoo, as
                previously reported. A roadside zoo near San Gabriel may,
                according to its owner, have a better facility for the tiger
                than the Zoo, which currently has no exhibit designed for
                tigers.<br />

                />Donald T. Wilson, owner of Don Wilson's Wildlife Wonderland,
                pressed his claim yesterday for the tiger, which is being held
                in the Zoo's animal health clinic while it undergoes quarantine
                and its fate is decided. "We've got the perfect home for that
                poor tiger," he said. "We've got a big area for him to run and
                play--and we've got a female tiger here too, so he won't get
                lonely. I don't see how the zoo can beat that, especially at
                taxpayers' expense!"<br />
                <img
                  src="../../images/dot.gif"

                  alt="spacer gif"
                />"Give the tiger to my zoo," Wilson added, "and we'll have some
                cute cubs in no time flat. Give him to the Zoo and you may never
                see any cubs, with all their red tape and regulations about
                breeding." Wilson said that, unlike the city Zoo, he regularly
                takes his animals to schools and shopping malls. "I'm helping
                educate kids about these animals. The Zoo never lets their
                animals out of their cages."<br />

                  />However, Barry Grady, the Director of Powderkeg Zoo in
                  Flint, Michigan, and coordinator of the Sumatran Tiger Species
                  Survival Plan (SSP) for the American Association of Zoological
                  Parks and Aquariums (AZA), expressed some concern about
                  Wilson's plan.<br />
                  <img
                    src="../../images/dot.gif"

                    alt="spacer gif"
                  />"Tigers are solitary animals," he said in a telephone
                  interview. "They don't like company so soon--especially that
                  of a female, unless she's in estrus. This tiger just needs to
                  settle down into his environment for a few months."<br />
                  <img
                    src="../../images/dot.gif"
                    width="5"

                    alt="spacer gif"
                  />Brady added that the proper place for the tiger was not a
                  roadside tourist attraction but a zoo which had been
                  accredited by the AZA. "In that way, we can continually
                  monitor the health of this tiger through our accreditation
                  process. This also ensures that the tiger will have proper
                  medical care, and that it will have a balanced diet. Most
                  importantly, it means this tiger can be used to further
                  <i>real</i> conservation efforts to help educate the public
                  about the tiger's plight in the wild."

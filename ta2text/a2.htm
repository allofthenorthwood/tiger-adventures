                  escaping from airport customs may not end up at the San
                  Gabriel Zoo, as previously reported. A roadside zoo near San
                  Gabriel may, according to its owner, have a better facility
                  for the tiger than the Zoo, which currently has no exhibit
                  designed for tigers.<br />

                  />Donald T. Wilson, owner of Don Wilson's Wildlife Wonderland,
                  pressed his claim yesterday for the tiger, which is being held
                  in the Zoo's animal health clinic while it undergoes
                  quarantine and its fate is decided. "We've got the
                  perfect home for that poor tiger," he said. "We've
                  got a big area for him to run and play--and we've got a female
                  tiger here too, so he won't get lonely. I don't see how the
                  zoo can beat that, especially at taxpayers' expense!"<br />
                  <img
                    src="../../images/dot.gif"

                    alt="spacer gif"
                  />"Give the tiger to my zoo," Wilson added,
                  "and we'll have some cute cubs in no time flat. Give him
                  to the Zoo and you may never see any cubs, with all their red
                  tape and regulations about breeding." Wilson said that,
                  unlike the city Zoo, he regularly takes his animals to schools
                  and shopping malls. "I'm helping educate kids about these
                  animals. The Zoo never lets their animals out of their
                  cages."<br />

                    Flint, Michigan, and coordinator of the Sumatran Tiger
                    Species Survival Plan (SSP) for the American Association of
                    Zoological Parks and Aquariums (AZA), expressed some concern
                    about Wilson's plan. <br />
                    <img
                      src="../../images/dot.gif"

                      alt="spacer gif"
                    />"Tigers are solitary animals," he said in a
                    telephone interview. "They don't like company so
                    soon--especially that of a female, unless she's in estrus.
                    This tiger just needs to settle down into his environment
                    for a few months." <br />
                    <img
                      src="../../images/dot.gif"

                      alt="spacer gif"
                    />Brady added that the proper place for the tiger was not a
                    roadside tourist attraction but a zoo which had been
                    accredited by the AZA. "In that way, we can continually
                    monitor the health of this tiger through our accreditation
                    process. This also ensures that the tiger will have proper
                    medical care, and that it will have a balanced diet. Most
                    importantly, it means this tiger can be used to further
                    <i>real </i>conservation efforts to help educate the public
                    about the tiger's plight in the wild."

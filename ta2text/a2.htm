Sumatran tiger that was captured yesterday after escaping from airport customs 
may not end up at the San Gabriel Zoo, as previously reported. A roadside zoo 
near San Gabriel may, according to its owner, have a better facility for the tiger 
than the Zoo, which currently has no exhibit designed for tigers.<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">Donald 
T. Wilson, owner of Don Wilson's Wildlife Wonderland, pressed his claim yesterday 
for the tiger, which is being held in the Zoo's animal health clinic while it 
undergoes quarantine and its fate is decided. &quot;We've got the perfect home 
for that poor tiger,&quot; he said. &quot;We've got a big area for him to run 
and play--and we've got a female tiger here too, so he won't get lonely. I don't 
see how the zoo can beat that, especially at taxpayers' expense!&quot;<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">&quot;Give 
the tiger to my zoo,&quot; Wilson added, &quot;and we'll have some cute cubs in 
no time flat. Give him to the Zoo and you may never see any cubs, with all their 
red tape and regulations about breeding.&quot; Wilson said that, unlike the city 
Zoo, he regularly takes his animals to schools and shopping malls. &quot;I'm helping 
educate kids about these animals. The Zoo never lets their animals out of their 
cages.&quot;<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">(A 
schedule of animal appearances, along with more information about Wildlife Wonderland, 
can be found on its <a HREF="a3.htm">Web site</a>.)<br> </td><td WIDTH="33%" VALIGN="TOP"><p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="../ta2graph/incustdy.jpg" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="84" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="1" ALT="Tiger in custody"><br> 
<font SIZE="-1">This Sumatran tiger was captured yesterday after escaping from 
airport customs. Its fate is now being debated.</font></p><p><img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">However, 
Barry Grady, the Director of Powderkeg Zoo in Flint, Michigan, and coordinator 
of the Sumatran Tiger Species Survival Plan (SSP) for the American Association 
of Zoological Parks and Aquariums (AZA), expressed some concern about Wilson's 
plan. <br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">&quot;Tigers 
are solitary animals,&quot; he said in a telephone interview. &quot;They don't 
like company so soon--especially that of a female, unless she's in estrus. This 
tiger just needs to settle down into his environment for a few months.&quot; <br> 
<img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">Brady 
added that the proper place for the tiger was not a roadside tourist attraction 
but a zoo which had been accredited by the AZA. &quot;In that way, we can continually 
monitor the health of this tiger through our accreditation process. This also 
ensures that the tiger will have proper medical care, and that it will have a 
balanced diet. Most importantly, it means this tiger can be used to further <i>real 
</i>conservation efforts to help educate the public about the tiger's plight in 
the wild.&quot;</td></tr> </table></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font COLOR="#663300" SIZE="+1">What's

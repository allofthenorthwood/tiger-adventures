                    Wonderland, expressed hope yesterday that his captive tiger
                    and the tiger at the zoo would be bred. "It's a win-win
                    situation," he said. "They've got a male tiger,
                    I've got a female tiger. Why not let nature take her
                    course?" <br />

                    />Wilson, who fought zoo officials for custody of the tiger,
                    says he feels no ill will against the zoo. "Of course
                    they wanted the tiger--they've got to attract tourists to
                    the zoo. I just wish they were more devoted to educating our
                    young people about wildlife. But by breeding our tigers, I
                    think we can make a positive step forward together. I
                    sincerely hope it comes to pass."

                  house the Sumatran tiger which briefly roamed the area earlier
                  this year.<br />

                  />According to Zoo officials, the tiger enclosure incorporates
                  the best and most current thinking in zoo exhibit design.
                  "We've provided the tiger with a natural environment and
                  many things to enrich its life, such as scratching logs,
                  water, and heat pads, and of course a healthy diet. I hope
                  everyone comes out to the zoo to get to know our newest
                  resident."<br />

                  />Some zoo visitors complained that they could not see the
                  tiger. "He was always back there in the bushes, hiding or
                  something," said Danny Bence, age 10. "I came here
                  to see a tiger, not some stupid bushes." Other visitors
                  also voiced disappointment with the exhibit. "What's the
                  point of a big, beautiful enclosure if the tiger spends all
                  his time hiding in the woods?" asked Janet Morrison.

                    see, but defended the design of the exhibit. According to
                    the zookeeper, "We tried to strike a balance between
                    the tiger's well-being and the visitors' well-being. We'll
                    have to see what we can do to give people a better
                    experience."<br />

                    />Victor Sanchez, an employee at El Paso Zoo who came to San
                    Gabriel for the occasion, suggested that the zoo install a
                    concealed electrified barrier in the exhibit. "Cordon
                    off the back parts of the exhibit with 'hot wires,'" he
                    suggested. "They've got a small charge that'll
                    encourage the tiger to spend his time down by the visitors.
                    Maybe it sounds cruel, but it's not and the tiger will
                    figure it out pretty quickly. Zoos all over the country use
                    them."

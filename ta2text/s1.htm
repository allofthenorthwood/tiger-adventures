T. Wilson, owner of Don Wilson's Wildlife Wonderland, expressed hope yesterday 
that his captive tiger and the tiger at the zoo would be bred. &quot;It's a win-win 
situation,&quot; he said. &quot;They've got a male tiger, I've got a female tiger. 
Why not let nature take her course?&quot; <br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">Wilson, 
who fought zoo officials for custody of the tiger, says he feels no ill will against 
the zoo. &quot;Of course they wanted the tiger--they've got to attract tourists 
to the zoo. I just wish they were more devoted to educating our young people about 
wildlife. But by breeding our tigers, I think we can make a positive step forward 
together. I sincerely hope it comes to pass.&quot;</td></tr> <tr> <td WIDTH="33%" HEIGHT="510" VALIGN="TOP"><img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">The 
San Gabriel Zoo unveiled its new exhibit yesterday to house the Sumatran tiger 
which briefly roamed the area earlier this year.<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">According 
to Zoo officials, the tiger enclosure incorporates the best and most current thinking 
in zoo exhibit design. &quot;We've provided the tiger with a natural environment 
and many things to enrich its life, such as scratching logs, water, and heat pads, 
and of course a healthy diet. I hope everyone comes out to the zoo to get to know 
our newest resident.&quot;<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">Some 
zoo visitors complained that they could not see the tiger. &quot;He was always 
back there in the bushes, hiding or something,&quot; said Danny Bence, age 10. 
&quot;I came here to see a tiger, not some stupid bushes.&quot; Other visitors 
also voiced disappointment with the exhibit. &quot;What's the point of a big, 
beautiful enclosure if the tiger spends all his time hiding in the woods?&quot; 
asked Janet Morrison.</td><td WIDTH="33%" VALIGN="TOP"><p><img SRC="../ta2graph/tigexhbt.jpg" WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="94" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="1" ALT="Tiger in exhibit"><br>

officials acknowledged that the tiger was difficult to see, but defended the design 
of the exhibit. According to the zookeeper, &quot;We tried to strike a balance 
between the tiger's well-being and the visitors' well-being. We'll have to see 
what we can do to give people a better experience.&quot;<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">Victor 
Sanchez, an employee at El Paso Zoo who came to San Gabriel for the occasion, 
suggested that the zoo install a concealed electrified barrier in the exhibit. 
&quot;Cordon off the back parts of the exhibit with 'hot wires,'&quot; he suggested. 
&quot;They've got a small charge that'll encourage the tiger to spend his time 
down by the visitors. Maybe it sounds cruel, but it's not and the tiger will figure 
it out pretty quickly. Zoos all over the country use them.&quot;</td></tr> </table></h2><p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font COLOR="#663300" SIZE="+1">What

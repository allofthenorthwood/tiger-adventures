for Zoo Tiger Adventure<br> on the Tiger Information Center's web site (www.5tigers.org)</b></p><p>1. 
Who are you? What's your job? <b>Zookeeper at the San Gabriel Zoo in New Mexico.</b></p><p>2. 
Why does Don Wilson want the tiger? <b>Donald T. Wilson, owner of Don Wilson's 
Wildlife Wonderland, a private roadside zoo, makes these points: His zoo has a 
large area; the San Gabriel Zoo will have to build a new tiger exhibit at taxpayer 
expense. His zoo has a female tiger, for breeding and &quot;so he won't get lonely.&quot; 
The City Zoo will take much longer to breed the tiger, due to red tape and regulations 
about breeding. Also, unlike the city Zoo, Wilson regularly takes his animals 
to schools and shopping malls. &quot;I'm helping educate kids about these animals. 
The Zoo never lets their animals out of their cages.&quot;</b></p><p>3. Why does 
Barry Grady disagree with Don Wilson? <b>Grady says, Tigers are solitary animals. 
They don't like company so soon--especially that of a female, unless she's in 
estrus. This tiger just needs to settle down into his environment for a few months.&quot; 
Brady says the proper place for the tiger is not a roadside tourist attraction 
but a zoo which had been accredited by the American Zoological Association (AZA). 
&quot;In that way, we can continually monitor the health of this tiger through 
our accreditation process. This also ensures that the tiger will have proper medical 
care, and that it will have a balanced diet. Most importantly, it means this tiger 
can be used to further <i>real conservation efforts to help educate the public 
about the tiger's plight in the wild.&quot; </i></b></p><p>4. What important information 
does the veterinarian's report tell you? <b>The tiger is has a tattoo indicating 
it has been registered with the Tiger Studbook, and was born in a zoo. From the 
tattoo number, you learn that it is young male born three years ago at Bukittinggi 
Zoo in West Sumatra, Indonesia. It and its brother stolen when they were six months 
old. It has a pedigree and is a very valuable animal for breeding for conservation 
purposes.</b></p><p>5. Which area of the zoo would be the best place for the new 
tiger exhibit? Why? <b>Near the other cat exhibits, since tigers are a cat species.</b></p><p>6. 
Which exhibit design is the best? Why? <b>O'Connell Group's second plan. It is 
spacious and attractive. The dirt substrate (ground) and ample vegetation recreate 
the tiger's natural habitat while educating zoo visitors about the tiger's ecosystem. 
A moat ensures that the tiger will not escape, yet brings visitors face-to-face 
with the tigers. Vegetation screening blocks the fencing from view. Narrow chutes 
will help zookeepers guide the tiger between the exhibit and the underground off-exhibit 
night rooms. Other plans will have negative effects on final exhibit.</b></p><p>7. 
Which plan for the exhibit's environment is best? Why? <b>Mary Dees' second plan. 
It has water (a pool), enrichment elements (a scratching log, heat pads), and 
safe plantings (Cedar (<i>Cedrus sp.), juniper (</i>Juniperus sp.), barberry (<i>Berberis 
sp.)). </i>Other plans will have negative effects on final exhibit.</b></p><p>8. 
Which veterinarian has the best plan for caring for the tiger? Why? <b>Dr. Sara 
Cruz's plan. It uses both commercially-prepared food and animal carcasses. The 
tiger will receive its primary meal at night, in its holding room, so its appetite--and 
thus its health--can be monitored daily. The tiger would also be fed an occasional 
animal carcass in the exhibit, for the benefit of both zoo visitors and the tiger 
itself. Other plans will have negative effects on final exhibit.</b></p><p>9. 
What problems does your final tiger exhibit have? What mistakes did you make? 
<b>Answer depends on choices made during the game. There are a dozen possible 
endings.</b><br> </p><p>Back to <a HREF="ta2guide.htm">Zoo Tiger Teachers' Guide</a><br>

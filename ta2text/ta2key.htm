      1. Who are you? What's your job?
      <b>Zookeeper at the San Gabriel Zoo in New Mexico.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Why does Don Wilson want the tiger?
      <b
        >Donald T. Wilson, owner of Don Wilson's Wildlife Wonderland, a private
        roadside zoo, makes these points: His zoo has a large area; the San
        Gabriel Zoo will have to build a new tiger exhibit at taxpayer expense.
        His zoo has a female tiger, for breeding and "so he won't get
        lonely." The City Zoo will take much longer to breed the tiger, due
        to red tape and regulations about breeding. Also, unlike the city Zoo,
        Wilson regularly takes his animals to schools and shopping malls.
        "I'm helping educate kids about these animals. The Zoo never lets
        their animals out of their cages."</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Why does Barry Grady disagree with Don Wilson?
      <b
        >Grady says, Tigers are solitary animals. They don't like company so
        soon--especially that of a female, unless she's in estrus. This tiger
        just needs to settle down into his environment for a few months."
        Brady says the proper place for the tiger is not a roadside tourist
        attraction but a zoo which had been accredited by the American
        Zoological Association (AZA). "In that way, we can continually
        monitor the health of this tiger through our accreditation process. This
        also ensures that the tiger will have proper medical care, and that it
        will have a balanced diet. Most importantly, it means this tiger can be
        used to further
        <i
          >real conservation efforts to help educate the public about the
          tiger's plight in the wild."
        </i></b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      4. What important information does the veterinarian's report tell you?
      <b
        >The tiger is has a tattoo indicating it has been registered with the
        Tiger Studbook, and was born in a zoo. From the tattoo number, you learn
        that it is young male born three years ago at Bukittinggi Zoo in West
        Sumatra, Indonesia. It and its brother stolen when they were six months
        old. It has a pedigree and is a very valuable animal for breeding for
        conservation purposes.</b

    </p>
    <p>
      5. Which area of the zoo would be the best place for the new tiger
      exhibit? Why?
      <b>Near the other cat exhibits, since tigers are a cat species.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Which exhibit design is the best? Why?
      <b
        >O'Connell Group's second plan. It is spacious and attractive. The dirt
        substrate (ground) and ample vegetation recreate the tiger's natural
        habitat while educating zoo visitors about the tiger's ecosystem. A moat
        ensures that the tiger will not escape, yet brings visitors face-to-face
        with the tigers. Vegetation screening blocks the fencing from view.
        Narrow chutes will help zookeepers guide the tiger between the exhibit
        and the underground off-exhibit night rooms. Other plans will have
        negative effects on final exhibit.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Which plan for the exhibit's environment is best? Why?
      <b
        >Mary Dees' second plan. It has water (a pool), enrichment elements (a
        scratching log, heat pads), and safe plantings (Cedar (<i
          >Cedrus sp.), juniper (</i
        >Juniperus sp.), barberry (<i>Berberis sp.)). </i>Other plans will have
        negative effects on final exhibit.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Which veterinarian has the best plan for caring for the tiger? Why?
      <b
        >Dr. Sara Cruz's plan. It uses both commercially-prepared food and
        animal carcasses. The tiger will receive its primary meal at night, in
        its holding room, so its appetite--and thus its health--can be monitored
        daily. The tiger would also be fed an occasional animal carcass in the
        exhibit, for the benefit of both zoo visitors and the tiger itself.
        Other plans will have negative effects on final exhibit.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      9. What problems does your final tiger exhibit have? What mistakes did you
      make?
      <b
        >Answer depends on choices made during the game. There are a dozen
        possible endings.</b

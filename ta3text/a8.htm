                ours is, but that doesn't mean we can breed them. The purpose of
                zoos' captive management and breeding programs is to build a
                "genetic insurance policy" for the future. Someday the wild
                tiger population may become so small and inbred that it cannot
                survive without help. We may have to strengthen it by
                reintroducing new genes into the wild population--either the
                genetic code alone or the animals themselves.</font

                but to maintain as much genetic diversity as possible among
                captive tigers. We may know that Toni the Tiger is Sumatran, but
                we don't know who her parents, much less her grandparents, were.
                Without knowing her lineage, and her genetic history, we don't
                know how she would affect the gene pool of all captive tigers.
                We might also unknowingly breed her with a close relative. No,
                we must make every effort to make the genetic pool as diverse as
                possible. The survival of the world's tigers may depend on
                it."</font

I'm a zookeeper here and I'd like to explain to you all some things that Don Wilson 
hasn't. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Don Wilson may have found that his tiger 
is Sumatran, just as ours is, but that doesn't mean we can breed them. The purpose 
of zoos' captive management and breeding programs is to build a &quot;genetic 
insurance policy&quot; for the future. Someday the wild tiger population may become 
so small and inbred that it cannot survive without help. We may have to strengthen 
it by reintroducing new genes into the wild population--either the genetic code 
alone or the animals themselves.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;So the point 
today is not to breed as many tigers as we can, but to maintain as much genetic 
diversity as possible among captive tigers. We may know that Toni the Tiger is 
Sumatran, but we don't know who her parents, much less her grandparents, were. 
Without knowing her lineage, and her genetic history, we don't know how she would 
affect the gene pool of all captive tigers. We might also unknowingly breed her 
with a close relative. No, we must make every effort to make the genetic pool 
as diverse as possible. The survival of the world's tigers may depend on it.&quot;</FONT></TD></TR>

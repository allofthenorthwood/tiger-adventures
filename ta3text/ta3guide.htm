the Tiger!&quot; Teachers' Guide</h2><p><b>What is it?</b> &quot;Save the Tiger!&quot; 
is an online interactive adventure designed to teach about captive tiger breeding, 
the role of zoos in the conservation of endangered species, and the genetics of 
breeding wild animals.</p><p><b>The Scene:</b> You are a zookeeper in a fictional 
southwestern city. You must made decisions about the breeding plans for a recently-captured 
Sumatran tiger (acquired in &quot;Tiger on the Loose,&quot; and for which you 
designed an exhibit in &quot;Zoo Tiger&quot;). You must debate the fate of the 
tiger with the proprietor of a roadside zoo. He wants to breed your tiger with 
his female, and you must deal with him throughout the game. You must also select 
the best mate to breed with your tiger, based on genetic and other considerations.</p><p><b>Who 
Can Play? </b>Students can play independently or in small groups. You could also 
project it on a screen for a whole class activity.</p><p>&quot;Save the Tiger!&quot; 
is written for fifth grade and older. There is a significant amount of text in 
the form of fictional newspaper articles, letters and memos. Players participate 
in a mock-debate about captive breeding of endangered species. They must also 
learn some fairly difficult information about genetics to finish the game successfully.</p><p>All 
our Tiger Adventures are designed to download quickly using Netscape 2 and Exlplorer 
3 and above.</p><p><b>How To Play: </b>Encourage students to read and look carefully 
before making choices. The Tiger Handbook will provide the necessary information 
construct a successful and healthy exhibit for your tiger. The Tiger Handbook 
also challenges players to consider the role of zoos in our society as well as 
how to balance the needs of the animals with the desires of the public.</p><p>You 
may want to assign the <a href="ta3work.htm">Save the Tiger Worksheet</a> to focus 
and track your students' progress. Use the <a HREF="ta3key.htm">teacher key</a>

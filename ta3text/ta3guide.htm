    <p>
      <b>What is it?</b> "Save the Tiger!" is an online interactive
      adventure designed to teach about captive tiger breeding, the role of zoos
      in the conservation of endangered species, and the genetics of breeding
      wild animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Scene:</b> You are a zookeeper in a fictional southwestern city.
      You must made decisions about the breeding plans for a recently-captured
      Sumatran tiger (acquired in "Tiger on the Loose," and for which
      you designed an exhibit in "Zoo Tiger"). You must debate the
      fate of the tiger with the proprietor of a roadside zoo. He wants to breed
      your tiger with his female, and you must deal with him throughout the
      game. You must also select the best mate to breed with your tiger, based
      on genetic and other considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Who Can Play? </b>Students can play independently or in small groups.
      You could also project it on a screen for a whole class activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Save the Tiger!" is written for fifth grade and older. There is
      a significant amount of text in the form of fictional newspaper articles,
      letters and memos. Players participate in a mock-debate about captive
      breeding of endangered species. They must also learn some fairly difficult
      information about genetics to finish the game successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      All our Tiger Adventures are designed to download quickly using Netscape 2
      and Exlplorer 3 and above.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>How To Play: </b>Encourage students to read and look carefully before
      making choices. The Tiger Handbook will provide the necessary information
      construct a successful and healthy exhibit for your tiger. The Tiger
      Handbook also challenges players to consider the role of zoos in our
      society as well as how to balance the needs of the animals with the
      desires of the public.
    </p>
    <p>

      1. Who are you? What's your job?
      <b>Zookeeper at the San Gabriel Zoo in New Mexico.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Why does Don Wilson say the Zoo's tiger should be bred with his female?
      What are his arguments?
      <b
        >Wilson does not agree with the tiger conservation and breeding policies
        set by the American Zoological Association (AZA) and followed the the
        City Zoo. He accuses the Zoo of wanting "to create an elite breed of
        purebred tigers. Ordinary, working-class tigers like our Toni just don't
        cut it!"</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <b
        >He also points out that the City Zoo may not breed the male tiger for
        years, due to limits set by the AZA on the number of captive tigers in
        North American zoos. Wilson says he has plenty of space for cubs, and
        "If we get too many, we'll just ship some back to Asia and release them
        back into the wild."</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      3. What is your response?
      <b
        >Students can go Wilson's route (and lose their job), or they can make
        this argument: " The purpose of the Tiger Species Survival Plan (SSP) is
        not simply to breed as many tigers as we can. If we did that, we'd soon
        run out of room--and money to care for the tigers. We all want to save
        the species--that's a primary mission for zoos today. But we have to do
        so in a scientific manner. We don't even know what subspecies of tiger
        your female (Toni) is. If we bred our tiger with yours, we could end up
        with hybrids across subspecies. No one knows what kind of hybrid the
        cubs would be--that's the point, and the danger. There's nothing wrong
        with a hybrid animal itself, but hybrid animals hurt conservation
        efforts by muddying the genetic pool. The only way to preserve the
        genetic strength and diversity of captive tigers is through scientific
        methods.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Summarize your talk to the picketers outside your office:
      <b
        >Students can summarize this speech: "Don Wilson may have found that his
        tiger is Sumatran, just as ours is, but that doesn't mean we can breed
        them. The purpose of zoos' captive management and breeding programs is
        to build a "genetic insurance policy" for the future. Someday the wild
        tiger population may become so small and inbred that it cannot survive
        without help. We may have to strengthen it by reintroducing new genes
        into the wild population--either the genetic code alone or the animals
        themselves.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <b
        >"So the point today is not to breed as many tigers as we can, but to
        maintain as much genetic diversity as possible among captive tigers. We
        may know that Toni the Tiger is Sumatran, but we don't know who her
        parents , much less her grandparents, were. Without knowing her lineage,
        and her genetic history, we don't know how she would affect the gene
        pool of all captive tigers. We might also unknowingly breed her with a
        close relative. No, we must make every effort to make the genetic pool
        as diverse as possible. The survival of the world's tigers may depend on
        it."</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      4. What genetic criteria should you consider when selecting a mate for
      Jambi?
      <b
        >Criteria should include some or all of these: Gene diversity, Founder
        Genome Equivalents (FGE), Mean Kinship Value, and Inbreeding
        Coefficient.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Which female tiger do you decide to mate with Jambi? Why?
      <b
        >There are several decent matches, but the best mate would be Sasha. If
        two cubs were born, the net change in gene diversity for all of captive
        Sumatran tigers would increase by 0.10%, rising from 91.41 (that is,
        91.41% of the original gene diversity still retained) to 91.51. And
        because Sasha comes from Dallas-a nearby, warm-weather zoo-she would
        suffer few ill effects from the transfer and probably breed
        successfully. While other females might produce a higher gene diversity,
        our management group agrees that Sasha is the best choice</b
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. What happens when Jambi tries to mate with the female tiger you chose?
      <b
        >Various results, depending on which female the student chose. Some
        females are not very fertile, others too old or too young. Several will
        bear cubs--in these cases, the difference comes from the effect on the
        genetic pool of captive tiger. Some choices will improve the genetic
        pool, others will not.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      6. At the end of the game, did you get a successful breeding? Are cubs
      born?
      <b
        >Some matings will result in cubs, others will not, but students always
        have a chance to keep trying until they get a successful mating.<br />

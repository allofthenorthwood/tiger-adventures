                />Two Sumatran tiger cubs were born this week to much fanfare at
                the San Gabriel Zoo. The cubs will meet the public next week in
                a grand celebration which may be spoiled only by Don Wilson and
                his "Save the Tiger!" organization, which has been picketing the
                Zoo for over a year.<br />
                <img
                  src="../../images/dot.gif"
                  width="5"

                  alt="spacer gif"
                />According to Anne Zimmerman, director of the San Gabriel Zoo,
                the real celebration is not simply the birth of two cute tiger
                cubs. "What we at the Zoo are celebrating is the contribution
                these cubs make to global tiger conservation efforts. Their
                arrival has improved gene diversity among captive Sumatran
                tigers, bolstering our efforts to develop a healthy zoo
                population which may one day be called upon to help save wild
                tiger populations."

                />From his picket line, Don Wilson acknowledged the Zoo's
                success, but added that his private zoo ought to have equal
                access to the tiger. "In a fair and equitable society, all zoos
                should have the chance to breed cubs. As a businessman, I'm
                going to suffer from the Zoo's monopoly on tiger cubs. It just
                doesn't seem like the American way to me."<br />

                  alt="spacer gif"
                />Zoo officials brushed off Wilson's complaints. "We're here to
                help save an endangered species," said Zimmerman. "This week we
                made a small but important step in that direction."

Sumatran tiger cubs were born this week to much fanfare at the San Gabriel Zoo. 
The cubs will meet the public next week in a grand celebration which may be spoiled 
only by Don Wilson and his &quot;Save the Tiger!&quot; organization, which has 
been picketing the Zoo for over a year.<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">According 
to Anne Zimmerman, director of the San Gabriel Zoo, the real celebration is not 
simply the birth of two cute tiger cubs. &quot;What we at the Zoo are celebrating 
is the contribution these cubs make to global tiger conservation efforts. Their 
arrival has improved gene diversity among captive Sumatran tigers, bolstering 
our efforts to develop a healthy zoo population which may one day be called upon 
to help save wild tiger populations.&quot;</td><td WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="TOP"><img SRC="../ta3graph/cub.jpg" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="148" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="1" ALT="tiger cub"><img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">From 
his picket line, Don Wilson acknowledged the Zoo's success, but added that his 
private zoo ought to have equal access to the tiger. &quot;In a fair and equitable 
society, all zoos should have the chance to breed cubs. As a businessman, I'm 
going to suffer from the Zoo's monopoly on tiger cubs. It just doesn't seem like 
the American way to me.&quot;<br> <img SRC="../../images/dot.gif" WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="spacer gif">Zoo 
officials brushed off Wilson's complaints. &quot;We're here to help save an endangered 
species,&quot; said Zimmerman. &quot;This week we made a small but important step 
in that direction.&quot;</td></tr> </table><table WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0">
